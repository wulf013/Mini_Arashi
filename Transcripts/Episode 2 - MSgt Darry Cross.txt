WEBVTT

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.840
<v SPEAKER_1>For episode two we have Joyce and Darry Cross.

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:37.085
<v SPEAKER_2>This is Oregon, it's like a Canadian blend.

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:38.625
<v SPEAKER_2>It's pretty good.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:40.365
<v SPEAKER_1>From Oregon, huh?

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:42.865
<v SPEAKER_1>Let me use it right here.

00:00:46.065 --> 00:01:03.405
<v SPEAKER_1>So for episode two of Top Game, I had the idea to actually sit down with some of our new cohort, the group of mass sergeants that were recently selected this year, Fiscal Year 18.

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:16.785
<v SPEAKER_1>But when appropriate, when available, and when they were open to it, to include the wife in the conversation.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:30.145
<v SPEAKER_1>So I'm glad that Joyce is willing to sit down with us and have this conversation, because I'm a firm believer that I would not be even a fourth of the Marine that I am had it not been for Liz.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:35.805
<v SPEAKER_1>And I think that that applies to a lot of us.

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:39.965
<v SPEAKER_1>But what do you think?

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:48.645
<v SPEAKER_1>With the understanding that she's right here in front of you, what impact has she had on you as a professional?

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:50.985
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I totally agree.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:02:11.965
<v SPEAKER_2>If you don't have somebody backing you up, you know, there to support you, whether it be taking care of the things at home, I can tell you she's the banker in this house, taking care of the bills, finances, whatever.

00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:20.925
<v SPEAKER_2>And then even more so, these guys that's got children, 100%, I think it's hugely important.

00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:29.425
<v SPEAKER_2>I'll say everybody's going to have that rough patch somewhere down the line.

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:36.605
<v SPEAKER_2>We definitely had some boulders that we had to work our way through, but yeah, absolutely.

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:43.645
<v SPEAKER_2>I wouldn't be sitting here at this table today if it wasn't for her, guaranteed.

00:02:43.945 --> 00:03:23.805
<v SPEAKER_2>So what does it mean to you, the fact that you've made it to the point of being a Master Sergeant of Marines, I don't know if I ever saw myself here getting to this point, but I'm a pretty firm believer that I can be successful where I'm planning or what not, but going back to having her at home or what not, I had full intentions on EAS and getting out and moving along.

00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:24.285
<v SPEAKER_1>What year?

00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:33.125
<v SPEAKER_2>When we left Texas, 2010, I was ready to be done.

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:34.065
<v SPEAKER_2>I was going to move along.

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:35.045
<v SPEAKER_1>And what year did you come in?

00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:35.965
<v SPEAKER_2>2003.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:37.725
<v SPEAKER_2>2003?

00:03:37.745 --> 00:03:39.445
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, 2003.

00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:51.785
<v SPEAKER_1>I say this a lot to junior Marines, and I have said this a lot to junior Marines over the years, but you came in knowing you were going to combat.

00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:53.245
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, absolutely.

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:56.845
<v SPEAKER_1>That was a given, especially in the Marine Corps.

00:03:57.965 --> 00:04:01.785
<v SPEAKER_1>Me and the guys that came in around me, I came in in 99.

00:04:02.505 --> 00:04:08.945
<v SPEAKER_1>And I had an instinctive feeling that we would be in a dust-up before too long.

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:17.765
<v SPEAKER_1>I had no idea what it was going to be like, you know, in this many years of sustained combat between Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere.

00:04:19.165 --> 00:04:26.585
<v SPEAKER_1>But in 2003, things were still pretty heated, and you enlisted anyway.

00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:41.265
<v SPEAKER_2>Being in high school, not trying to toot my patriotic horn, but you see all the stuff going on after the whole September 11th, all that deal.

00:04:41.665 --> 00:04:46.325
<v SPEAKER_2>And then I was ready to get involved.

00:04:47.325 --> 00:04:52.125
<v SPEAKER_2>At that time, I obviously had no idea which way it was going, or where exactly I was going to with it.

00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:55.705
<v SPEAKER_2>But I already had in my mind what I was going to do.

00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:59.065
<v SPEAKER_1>And where's home for the Cross family?

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:00.465
<v SPEAKER_2>Kentucky.

00:05:01.565 --> 00:05:02.265
<v SPEAKER_1>Kentucky.

00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:03.025
<v SPEAKER_2>Kentucky.

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:09.405
<v SPEAKER_2>I grew up in southeast Kentucky, and Joyce, she's from northeast Kentucky.

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:15.905
<v SPEAKER_1>One of my favorite lines from the movie Last Mohicans is when the British officer tells the colonials, he says, there's a war going on.

00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:19.265
<v SPEAKER_1>How is it that you're headed west to Kentucky?

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:20.825
<v SPEAKER_1>He says, it's real easy.

00:05:20.845 --> 00:05:21.565
<v SPEAKER_1>We face north.

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:25.045
<v SPEAKER_1>We face north, and real subtle, like we turn left.

00:05:27.805 --> 00:05:29.345
<v SPEAKER_1>I've seen that movie I don't know how many times.

00:05:30.465 --> 00:05:32.325
<v SPEAKER_2>That's a pretty great movie.

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:37.665
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, like I say, I kind of already had in my mind what I was going to do.

00:05:39.025 --> 00:05:46.345
<v SPEAKER_2>Hadn't really been too much military involvement in my family for the generation before me.

00:05:48.945 --> 00:05:52.505
<v SPEAKER_2>Not to a great extent, but I had made my mind up already.

00:05:52.945 --> 00:05:57.625
<v SPEAKER_2>I would have probably been in the Army, to be honest with you.

00:05:57.645 --> 00:05:57.905
<v SPEAKER_1>Really?

00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:02.545
<v SPEAKER_2>I was in the Army JROTC program, talked to Army recruiters.

00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:04.545
<v SPEAKER_1>So you were all in and they were in high school.

00:06:04.785 --> 00:06:07.085
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, but the dude didn't call me back.

00:06:07.385 --> 00:06:08.565
<v SPEAKER_1>The dude didn't call you back?

00:06:08.645 --> 00:06:10.045
<v SPEAKER_2>And Marine Corps recruiters.

00:06:10.145 --> 00:06:10.985
<v SPEAKER_1>He was on the spot.

00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:11.885
<v SPEAKER_2>He was on the spot.

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:13.925
<v SPEAKER_1>Hustle and grind.

00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:17.765
<v SPEAKER_2>Yep, never let up and absolutely wouldn't change a thing.

00:06:18.285 --> 00:06:26.105
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, he came at me pretty hard and I was ready to roll with it.

00:06:26.665 --> 00:06:28.845
<v SPEAKER_2>And here we go, 15 years.

00:06:29.685 --> 00:06:31.205
<v SPEAKER_2>We're sitting here at this table now.

00:06:31.945 --> 00:06:32.265
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

00:06:32.285 --> 00:06:33.845
<v SPEAKER_2>Just recently promoted to Master Sergeant.

00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:35.845
<v SPEAKER_2>Pretty happy about that.

00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:37.025
<v SPEAKER_1>How does that make you feel, Joyce?

00:06:43.305 --> 00:06:49.745
<v SPEAKER_1>There's first things that he could be doing.

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:54.565
<v SPEAKER_1>How hard have the transitions been over the years, going from duty station to duty station?

00:06:56.985 --> 00:07:00.505
<v SPEAKER_3>Some harder than others.

00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:02.165
<v SPEAKER_2>Joyce is a family girl.

00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:04.285
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

00:07:04.425 --> 00:07:06.265
<v SPEAKER_1>And you're from Kentucky as well, I presume?

00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:07.205
<v SPEAKER_1>Same hometown?

00:07:07.685 --> 00:07:07.885
<v SPEAKER_2>No.

00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:10.785
<v SPEAKER_2>Took Camp Lejeune to bring us together.

00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:11.305
<v SPEAKER_1>Really?

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:16.765
<v SPEAKER_1>Because if I recall correctly, your whole family is Marine Corps.

00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:19.465
<v SPEAKER_1>Three brothers in the Marine Corps?

00:07:19.485 --> 00:07:20.525
<v SPEAKER_3>One just retired, but yeah.

00:07:21.885 --> 00:07:22.305
<v SPEAKER_1>Father?

00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:22.845
<v SPEAKER_1>Uncles?

00:07:23.405 --> 00:07:24.925
<v SPEAKER_3>My dad was in the Army.

00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:25.985
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay.

00:07:26.005 --> 00:07:26.765
<v SPEAKER_1>What did he say about his...

00:07:31.245 --> 00:07:32.445
<v SPEAKER_1>Your father was in the Army.

00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:36.265
<v SPEAKER_1>He has three sons in the Marine Corps, but he tried to talk him into going to the Air Force.

00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:39.285
<v SPEAKER_1>That's a father looking out for the welfare of his children.

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:45.045
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, you talk about a sweating corporal.

00:07:45.445 --> 00:07:45.725
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:48.845
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, when I met her...

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.405
<v SPEAKER_1>Was her dad still in when y'all met?

00:07:51.105 --> 00:07:52.365
<v SPEAKER_2>No, her dad was not, but...

00:07:52.385 --> 00:07:54.645
<v SPEAKER_2>Her brothers were?

00:07:54.665 --> 00:07:58.705
<v SPEAKER_2>Her brothers were, what, at the time, Staff Sergeant and two gunnies?

00:07:59.285 --> 00:08:00.685
<v SPEAKER_2>Two Staff Sarts and a gunny.

00:08:01.285 --> 00:08:02.665
<v SPEAKER_1>And you were a corporal?

00:08:02.685 --> 00:08:03.425
<v SPEAKER_2>Here comes old corporal.

00:08:03.445 --> 00:08:03.885
<v SPEAKER_2>How did y'all meet?

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:07.225
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, between a bar and a rodeo.

00:08:09.905 --> 00:08:11.745
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, a mutual friend, you know, a friend that we had.

00:08:11.765 --> 00:08:12.445
<v SPEAKER_1>Who was this friend?

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:14.785
<v SPEAKER_2>A guy by the name of JD.

00:08:14.805 --> 00:08:15.125
<v SPEAKER_2>Brody.

00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:16.125
<v SPEAKER_1>Brody.

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:19.585
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, he was a MP back in the day.

00:08:20.385 --> 00:08:23.265
<v SPEAKER_2>Had gotten out, stayed around Camp Lejeune.

00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:25.205
<v SPEAKER_2>One of her brothers knew him pretty well.

00:08:25.925 --> 00:08:28.165
<v SPEAKER_2>And how'd you meet him?

00:08:29.345 --> 00:08:31.705
<v SPEAKER_2>At the rodeo.

00:08:32.725 --> 00:08:33.725
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, he pulled gates.

00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:38.445
<v SPEAKER_2>He was a gate man at some of the bull ridings we were going to back then.

00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:39.825
<v SPEAKER_1>Were you riding bulls back then?

00:08:40.005 --> 00:08:40.465
<v SPEAKER_2>I was.

00:08:41.005 --> 00:08:44.005
<v SPEAKER_2>I was eating more dirt than I was riding, but I was getting on a bunch.

00:08:44.445 --> 00:08:52.825
<v SPEAKER_1>So you were active duty Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, excuse me, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, 2nd Radio Battalion, and you were riding bulls on your off time.

00:08:52.945 --> 00:08:53.425
<v SPEAKER_2>I was.

00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:58.445
<v SPEAKER_1>Did you have to sign a chip for that or ask for special permission?

00:08:59.565 --> 00:09:00.665
<v SPEAKER_2>So I did not.

00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:02.645
<v SPEAKER_2>I'll tell you how.

00:09:02.665 --> 00:09:09.485
<v SPEAKER_2>I remember a gentleman at the time, Lieutenant Brand, I believe Major Brand now, in the reserve down there in Texas.

00:09:09.965 --> 00:09:10.985
<v SPEAKER_2>Definitely a good man.

00:09:11.165 --> 00:09:17.345
<v SPEAKER_2>He's the only person that ever questioned what we were doing.

00:09:17.745 --> 00:09:22.265
<v SPEAKER_2>And you know, some of the units, a lot of the guys were with some of the air wing units there at Cherry Point.

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:29.605
<v SPEAKER_2>And we had sort of, I don't know, came up with our own system to get around that a little bit.

00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:37.545
<v SPEAKER_2>And we'd go to this, what we call a riding school, you know, some of the more senior guys that really knew what was going on.

00:09:38.005 --> 00:09:42.205
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, it would be a day or two of like, kind of instruction, and really just getting on a lot of bulls.

00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:54.145
<v SPEAKER_2>But along with a certificate from there at the end of the day to say that, you know, you kind of knew what you were doing at least, and agreeing you would wear your vest.

00:09:54.925 --> 00:09:56.425
<v SPEAKER_2>And some of the guys even had to wear helmets.

00:09:58.345 --> 00:09:59.545
<v SPEAKER_2>Their commands didn't have problems.

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:03.485
<v SPEAKER_2>But at the time, Lieutenant Brand, he was the only one questioning, you know, what we were really doing.

00:10:04.165 --> 00:10:11.205
<v SPEAKER_2>And, you know, it turned out our out force.

00:10:11.225 --> 00:10:13.265
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, we didn't never really have any problems.

00:10:13.265 --> 00:10:14.005
<v SPEAKER_2>Knock on wood.

00:10:14.425 --> 00:10:17.965
<v SPEAKER_2>Nobody got, none of our, the guys we were running with really got hurt too bad.

00:10:18.745 --> 00:10:24.085
<v SPEAKER_2>But, you know, I used to have some of the, some of the staffing show folks back there at the Rabin.

00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:27.625
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, they'd come to some of the bull runs that were close by and come watch.

00:10:28.025 --> 00:10:32.565
<v SPEAKER_1>I asked because around that time, I remember George Lockhart got in trouble for fighting.

00:10:35.805 --> 00:10:42.545
<v SPEAKER_2>I think one of the things maybe that helped us a little bit, you know, we were kind of small-time anyway, especially then.

00:10:44.005 --> 00:10:51.245
<v SPEAKER_2>There weren't a whole lot of people there around battalion that were super associated with rodeo and going to these shows and stuff.

00:10:51.265 --> 00:10:54.885
<v SPEAKER_2>So the fact that we kept everything a little quieter, it helped us out.

00:10:56.845 --> 00:10:59.065
<v SPEAKER_1>Don't get caught kind of thing.

00:10:59.085 --> 00:11:10.285
<v SPEAKER_2>We used to pull, you know, if we could get off by 1600 on a Tuesday night, we would, you know, I'm not condoning this by any means, but we would haul ass to Raleigh.

00:11:10.925 --> 00:11:16.925
<v SPEAKER_2>And on a Tuesday night, there was a place called Carousel Farms, and they had a pretty neat little board out in there.

00:11:18.225 --> 00:11:19.105
<v SPEAKER_2>We'd all get on our bulls.

00:11:19.125 --> 00:11:21.325
<v SPEAKER_2>If nobody made the short go, we'd turn around and come back.

00:11:21.485 --> 00:11:22.945
<v SPEAKER_1>What's the short go?

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:37.625
<v SPEAKER_2>Basically, you say everybody's going to get on one or two head, and then you're going to take your top scores out of that, or if they don't have enough people to make, you know, to have scores, they'll draw you back on time basically, so whoever stayed on the longest.

00:11:37.645 --> 00:11:40.185
<v SPEAKER_2>But anyways, that's going to give you a whole nother round of bulls to get on.

00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:43.825
<v SPEAKER_2>And if nobody made that, we'd haul it back.

00:11:43.845 --> 00:11:47.345
<v SPEAKER_2>If somebody did, we'd all wait and hope somebody made a couple dollars.

00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:50.265
<v SPEAKER_2>But it was a good time either way.

00:11:50.605 --> 00:11:59.405
<v SPEAKER_1>I've done some crazy shit in my life, but I don't think I would ever have the gumption to get on top of a bull that size and hold on for dear life.

00:11:59.705 --> 00:12:01.005
<v SPEAKER_1>How about, how big are these animals?

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:12.165
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, you know, you got a pretty big range there, but you're looking at, you know, somewhere between 1,300, 1,400 to 2,000 pounds, you know.

00:12:12.745 --> 00:12:14.745
<v SPEAKER_2>You got some small ones.

00:12:14.765 --> 00:12:16.085
<v SPEAKER_2>Usually small ones are a lot faster.

00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:23.025
<v SPEAKER_2>They can really throw some kinks at you, and then the bigger, a lot of times, they're just going to have a lot more power.

00:12:24.645 --> 00:12:40.905
<v SPEAKER_2>But, you know, kind of on that note, I took a bunch of young dudes, you know, guys at the unit or battalion or whatnot, and took them out to practice pins, you know, places where we go just to get on to practice pools and such.

00:12:42.205 --> 00:12:43.945
<v SPEAKER_2>They never got anybody hurt, you know, in ways.

00:12:43.965 --> 00:12:56.605
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm not going to put them on something crazy super rank to start out anyway, but I've been able to tie quite a few dudes into getting humbles.

00:12:56.785 --> 00:13:02.405
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, just recently, one of Sonny's guys, I took him to this place here on the island, believe it or not.

00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:04.285
<v SPEAKER_1>Bull riding in Hawaii.

00:13:04.305 --> 00:13:08.305
<v SPEAKER_2>There's a guy raising some pretty ranked buckers right here on the Oahu.

00:13:09.065 --> 00:13:11.345
<v SPEAKER_2>And I took one of his guys down there.

00:13:11.705 --> 00:13:12.865
<v SPEAKER_2>It's only been a few months back.

00:13:14.885 --> 00:13:19.605
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, people here, especially you get these guys that are in for a thrill or rush, you know what I mean?

00:13:20.105 --> 00:13:23.385
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, they hear about that.

00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:29.525
<v SPEAKER_2>And that's one of the two things I can talk about all day is rodeo, bull riding in particular, and bass fishing.

00:13:30.865 --> 00:13:33.725
<v SPEAKER_2>And, you know, I get to tell them a lot of stories.

00:13:33.745 --> 00:13:37.665
<v SPEAKER_2>We go on deployment or whatnot, and everybody hears me talk about it, and they're like, I want to try this out.

00:13:41.985 --> 00:13:44.045
<v SPEAKER_2>It's like till we get home.

00:13:44.245 --> 00:13:47.665
<v SPEAKER_2>I probably shamed a few people into getting on some too.

00:13:48.925 --> 00:13:49.445
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah?

00:13:49.545 --> 00:13:51.845
<v SPEAKER_1>You want to apply peer pressure from time to time?

00:13:52.725 --> 00:13:53.425
<v SPEAKER_2>Every once in a while.

00:13:53.445 --> 00:13:55.085
<v SPEAKER_1>Do you use the quintessential no balls?

00:13:55.785 --> 00:13:56.845
<v SPEAKER_2>No, no, we...

00:13:57.565 --> 00:13:58.685
<v SPEAKER_2>I'll tell you this story.

00:13:58.705 --> 00:14:00.345
<v SPEAKER_1>Like the Marine Corps Triple Dog Deer, right?

00:14:02.785 --> 00:14:21.185
<v SPEAKER_2>We used to kind of play a little dirty, but we'd go to some of these little honky tonk bars, you know, round base or whatnot, and you see all these dudes all decked out, and they might have a pretty girlfriend or something like that, you know, and we just kind of prod them a little bit.

00:14:21.845 --> 00:14:36.405
<v SPEAKER_2>And, you know, agging the fact, not saying it to their face, but agging the fact on of, you know, you got the outfit, but you got the sand to back it up, basically.

00:14:36.425 --> 00:14:36.625
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

00:14:36.785 --> 00:14:41.965
<v SPEAKER_2>And especially when we were over there in North Carolina, we were probably pretty brutal.

00:14:42.265 --> 00:14:43.605
<v SPEAKER_1>A lot of cool cowboys.

00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:46.325
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, and you got the dude standing right in front of his girlfriend, what's he gonna say?

00:14:46.565 --> 00:14:46.805
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

00:14:47.405 --> 00:14:51.445
<v SPEAKER_2>And the minute you say, you get in and nod his head, you say, guess what?

00:14:51.465 --> 00:14:53.165
<v SPEAKER_2>It just so happens we're going to Marl.

00:14:57.385 --> 00:15:02.465
<v SPEAKER_1>He don't walk into an L-shaped ambush, didn't even realize it in front of his main squeeze.

00:15:03.025 --> 00:15:03.345
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

00:15:03.605 --> 00:15:04.045
<v SPEAKER_2>Okay.

00:15:04.785 --> 00:15:19.165
<v SPEAKER_2>But it's just like, you know, just like the Marine Corps, though, you can tell pretty quick what somebody is actually kind of knows what they're talking about or they don't.

00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:19.405
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

00:15:21.405 --> 00:15:23.785
<v SPEAKER_2>You get it brought back to ground zero pretty fast.

00:15:24.785 --> 00:15:56.645
<v SPEAKER_1>So it's funny that you mention that, because I've said recently at the MEF a couple of times when we're having conversations with some of the staff out there, when you might be one of the only battalion representatives on the line interacting with hire, I've had to warn some of our peers and also some of our seniors that they can't sleep on old Darry Cross.

00:15:58.065 --> 00:16:05.485
<v SPEAKER_1>Because he comes across as what someone else would deem to be just some slack jaw yokel.

00:16:06.025 --> 00:16:13.905
<v SPEAKER_1>He's probably one of the sharpest individuals you run across in uniform.

00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:22.025
<v SPEAKER_1>I've known you for quite a while, and I'll say that to anybody.

00:16:23.885 --> 00:16:27.405
<v SPEAKER_1>But what got you to that point?

00:16:30.065 --> 00:16:36.245
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, I've always kind of been not super outspoken.

00:16:37.445 --> 00:16:42.685
<v SPEAKER_2>A lot of times I try to sit back and listen a little more.

00:16:47.445 --> 00:16:54.985
<v SPEAKER_2>I get put sometimes in an uncomfortable position in a conversation when I don't know, when I feel like I'm not up to speed and shouldn't be in that conversation.

00:16:56.025 --> 00:16:57.925
<v SPEAKER_2>So I try to...

00:17:00.925 --> 00:17:08.985
<v SPEAKER_2>Basically, I'm not going to go lock horns with the dude unless I'm a little bit pretty sure of myself.

00:17:09.005 --> 00:17:13.225
<v SPEAKER_1>You make it sound like there's a lot of confrontation that takes place in the Marine Corps.

00:17:13.425 --> 00:17:16.065
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, we know how that goes.

00:17:16.585 --> 00:17:20.245
<v SPEAKER_2>The disagreements come in every direction sometimes.

00:17:20.285 --> 00:17:29.625
<v SPEAKER_2>But to the point, it's kind of funny you brought this up, especially of late.

00:17:31.165 --> 00:17:34.705
<v SPEAKER_2>Every once in a while, I've heard people kind of talking my name up a little bit.

00:17:35.225 --> 00:17:44.785
<v SPEAKER_2>And then on the drive home and during decompression that day or whatnot, kind of thinking to myself, I'm like, that's a little pressure.

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:47.385
<v SPEAKER_2>I gotta make sure now that I can live up to that.

00:17:47.745 --> 00:17:49.465
<v SPEAKER_1>You ain't a gunny no more, homie.

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:50.645
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

00:17:51.065 --> 00:18:03.905
<v SPEAKER_2>To make sure that you can live up to that reputation, because you may not be the one broadcasting it yourself, but somebody's out there for sure talking about you.

00:18:03.925 --> 00:18:08.805
<v SPEAKER_2>Whether that be good or bad, we've heard, I'm sure, both of them go both ways.

00:18:09.325 --> 00:18:10.485
<v SPEAKER_2>They're different guys we know.

00:18:10.745 --> 00:18:13.805
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, I don't know.

00:18:15.705 --> 00:18:17.045
<v SPEAKER_2>Make sure you know what you're talking about.

00:18:19.065 --> 00:18:20.025
<v SPEAKER_2>That'll get you a long way.

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:25.065
<v SPEAKER_2>Be a professional as far as in the job skill and your skill set.

00:18:28.185 --> 00:18:35.745
<v SPEAKER_2>Try to learn as much as you can, and do the best with what we have, because we know a lot of times we definitely don't have the greatest gear.

00:18:36.705 --> 00:18:40.185
<v SPEAKER_2>The greatest gear that's out there, or the most high speed or whatnot.

00:18:40.205 --> 00:18:51.025
<v SPEAKER_2>But being professional with what you got, knowing the gear that you've got, knowing how to use it, that'll get you there from the job aspect, I think.

00:18:52.585 --> 00:18:54.825
<v SPEAKER_2>And then dealings with people.

00:18:55.945 --> 00:19:02.365
<v SPEAKER_2>To me, I think that's a plus for me.

00:19:02.385 --> 00:19:04.325
<v SPEAKER_2>A feather in my hat, a nickel in my pocket or whatnot.

00:19:04.345 --> 00:19:06.545
<v SPEAKER_2>I think I can usually deal with people pretty good.

00:19:09.485 --> 00:19:11.745
<v SPEAKER_2>You'll quickly find out the people to...

00:19:13.665 --> 00:19:14.745
<v SPEAKER_2>It always goes back to...

00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:15.845
<v SPEAKER_2>I keep going back to that.

00:19:16.005 --> 00:19:17.345
<v SPEAKER_2>People that know what they're talking about.

00:19:18.025 --> 00:19:19.525
<v SPEAKER_2>Surround yourself with those people.

00:19:21.085 --> 00:19:22.345
<v SPEAKER_2>I've been very fortunate for that.

00:19:22.365 --> 00:19:24.545
<v SPEAKER_1>Dime con quien andas y te diré quien eres.

00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:27.565
<v SPEAKER_1>I sat at the sunny the other night, and he was like, what?

00:19:27.585 --> 00:19:30.625
<v SPEAKER_1>I said, you tell me who you walk with and I'll tell you who you are.

00:19:32.105 --> 00:19:38.425
<v SPEAKER_1>And that's something that's resonated with me since I was young and heard my grandmother say that to me.

00:19:38.445 --> 00:19:43.885
<v SPEAKER_1>And it's always made me conscious of the company you keep.

00:19:44.965 --> 00:19:48.545
<v SPEAKER_1>And that applies in a lot of ways to our professional lives, right?

00:19:48.565 --> 00:20:05.145
<v SPEAKER_1>But Marine Corps is different in that, you know, the guys you associate with and you surround yourself with, not only will they have an impact upon your professional development, but also your personal growth as a human being.

00:20:05.325 --> 00:20:06.525
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:06.645 --> 00:20:13.685
<v SPEAKER_1>And it's one of the reasons why I've worked, to be honest, to stay close to you.

00:20:14.325 --> 00:20:21.425
<v SPEAKER_1>Because Darry Cross, to me, has always been one of those guys that I just got to shoot straight with.

00:20:22.385 --> 00:20:25.265
<v SPEAKER_1>I can't, you mean because you've known me for so long?

00:20:27.505 --> 00:20:29.745
<v SPEAKER_1>I can't be dishonest.

00:20:30.345 --> 00:20:38.865
<v SPEAKER_1>I got to be true to you, to me, and to our friendship.

00:20:41.185 --> 00:20:45.785
<v SPEAKER_1>And if I ain't got enough to help us make board, I'll let you know.

00:20:45.805 --> 00:20:49.125
<v SPEAKER_1>It's like, hey, you know, I maybe got one and a P.

00:20:51.885 --> 00:20:54.785
<v SPEAKER_2>And I think that will get you a long way, too.

00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:59.025
<v SPEAKER_2>Everybody's not going to come into the shooting match knowing everything.

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:05.165
<v SPEAKER_2>And all along the way, you're going to find there's going to be times that, like you said, you come up a little bit short.

00:21:05.705 --> 00:21:10.325
<v SPEAKER_2>But don't try and shirk around that.

00:21:10.345 --> 00:21:10.865
<v SPEAKER_2>You know what I mean?

00:21:12.545 --> 00:21:13.285
<v SPEAKER_2>Let it be known.

00:21:13.745 --> 00:21:22.045
<v SPEAKER_2>And again, if you surround yourself with those right people, chances are they're going to be able to add to your game there.

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:24.185
<v SPEAKER_1>So for you, who are some of those right people?

00:21:26.165 --> 00:21:28.365
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, yourself, for one.

00:21:28.565 --> 00:21:32.185
<v SPEAKER_2>Like I said, we went way back.

00:21:32.225 --> 00:21:35.905
<v SPEAKER_2>I think I was able to pick up a lot from you along the way.

00:21:36.705 --> 00:21:37.605
<v SPEAKER_2>I appreciate that.

00:21:37.865 --> 00:21:38.765
<v SPEAKER_2>We're talking about Sonny.

00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:41.705
<v SPEAKER_2>A true professional in the game.

00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:48.645
<v SPEAKER_1>One of the first times I met Sonny, he had just got back from a shooting package.

00:21:48.745 --> 00:21:49.985
<v SPEAKER_1>And I hope he listens to this.

00:21:50.005 --> 00:21:51.505
<v SPEAKER_1>It just laughs his head off.

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:56.985
<v SPEAKER_1>And I was going to see a common brother.

00:21:57.005 --> 00:22:05.185
<v SPEAKER_1>And it was through this Marine, Joe Weldon, that me and Sonny got to really know each other.

00:22:06.545 --> 00:22:08.325
<v SPEAKER_1>You know, friend of a friend kind of thing.

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:11.965
<v SPEAKER_1>And they had just got back from a shooting package.

00:22:11.985 --> 00:22:20.325
<v SPEAKER_1>And Sonny was just enamored with his skill set, this recently acquired skill set with his 9mm.

00:22:20.845 --> 00:22:24.765
<v SPEAKER_1>And I remember him saying over and over again how he was a gunslinger now.

00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:34.025
<v SPEAKER_1>We were young sergeants back then, still coming up and trying to figure out our way around the battalion.

00:22:34.045 --> 00:22:35.745
<v SPEAKER_1>But yeah, Sonny was one of those guys.

00:22:36.345 --> 00:22:36.965
<v SPEAKER_1>But who else?

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:43.125
<v SPEAKER_2>Let's see, John Ward, Master Sergeant Ward.

00:22:44.805 --> 00:22:48.025
<v SPEAKER_2>We've kind of been following, me and Joyce have been following, we call it the Ward train.

00:22:49.325 --> 00:22:52.965
<v SPEAKER_2>We've kind of followed each other around quite a bit the last several years.

00:22:54.445 --> 00:23:02.705
<v SPEAKER_2>Had orders to recruit in duty in 2010, and luckily, knock on wood, I didn't want to go.

00:23:03.105 --> 00:23:04.265
<v SPEAKER_2>So I say luckily.

00:23:04.285 --> 00:23:04.845
<v SPEAKER_1>You and me both.

00:23:05.825 --> 00:23:06.705
<v SPEAKER_2>He was moving along.

00:23:06.925 --> 00:23:08.805
<v SPEAKER_2>He got picked up for the internship program.

00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:11.045
<v SPEAKER_2>Left a hot fill open.

00:23:11.065 --> 00:23:12.365
<v SPEAKER_1>For you guys, it's called MOSAP.

00:23:13.065 --> 00:23:13.625
<v SPEAKER_1>Is that correct?

00:23:13.865 --> 00:23:19.505
<v SPEAKER_2>The Military Operational Signals Analysis Program.

00:23:21.565 --> 00:23:24.665
<v SPEAKER_2>But he got picked up for that out there in Colorado.

00:23:26.305 --> 00:23:27.505
<v SPEAKER_2>He was with the Q squadrons.

00:23:28.585 --> 00:23:30.045
<v SPEAKER_2>They were about to go to Afghanistan.

00:23:30.585 --> 00:23:35.965
<v SPEAKER_2>So at that time, monitor, that's when Crawford gave me a shout.

00:23:36.385 --> 00:23:36.965
<v SPEAKER_1>Craw daddy.

00:23:37.065 --> 00:23:42.605
<v SPEAKER_2>And he said, hey, I heard you didn't care for those recruiting duty orders.

00:23:42.625 --> 00:23:44.765
<v SPEAKER_2>I said, no, I'll take whatever you got.

00:23:45.245 --> 00:23:51.045
<v SPEAKER_2>He said, well, how do you feel about Afghanistan, followed up by Cherry Point for a while.

00:23:51.045 --> 00:23:54.285
<v SPEAKER_1>I would go to combat before I could recruit duty.

00:23:54.405 --> 00:23:57.605
<v SPEAKER_2>I said, okay, sounds good to me.

00:23:57.625 --> 00:24:00.305
<v SPEAKER_2>I said, when do you need an answer?

00:24:00.325 --> 00:24:02.465
<v SPEAKER_2>He's like, no, I'm glad it sounds good.

00:24:02.485 --> 00:24:04.925
<v SPEAKER_2>He said, because I got your order sitting right here in front of me.

00:24:04.945 --> 00:24:14.465
<v SPEAKER_2>So, yep, Afghanistan looked a little better at the time than, absolutely better than recruiting duty for me.

00:24:14.665 --> 00:24:15.565
<v SPEAKER_1>It's funny you mentioned that.

00:24:15.565 --> 00:24:23.125
<v SPEAKER_1>Recently, I was up on Okuma, which is one of those military recreation facilities north of Okinawa.

00:24:23.585 --> 00:24:24.565
<v SPEAKER_1>It's run by the Air Force.

00:24:25.225 --> 00:24:33.085
<v SPEAKER_1>And our party included some senior staff and COs, master guns, gunnies, mass sergeants.

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:39.185
<v SPEAKER_1>And of the group, I was the only one that had not done a special duty assignment.

00:24:41.545 --> 00:24:54.645
<v SPEAKER_1>I'd done a tour at an embassy, about a three-year tour at the Dominican Republic, but no recruiting duty, no drill instructor duty, anything along those lines.

00:24:55.465 --> 00:24:57.065
<v SPEAKER_1>But these guys were all recruiters.

00:24:57.465 --> 00:25:13.305
<v SPEAKER_1>And to sit there and listen to them tell their war stories of how that duty will break you off if you're not careful makes me tip my hat to those that get through that successfully.

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:15.805
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, I fully agree.

00:25:16.605 --> 00:25:23.685
<v SPEAKER_2>At the time when that was all taking place, Joyce's brother, her youngest brother, he had just came off of recruiting duty.

00:25:24.265 --> 00:25:30.645
<v SPEAKER_2>And he looked me straight in the eye, and he said if he had to do it over again, he would have done something to get him disqualified.

00:25:30.665 --> 00:25:31.665
<v SPEAKER_2>Take that for what you will.

00:25:32.105 --> 00:25:41.105
<v SPEAKER_2>But it was all he could do to hang in there with keeping the family, keeping everything straight on that side, plus with work.

00:25:43.185 --> 00:25:51.005
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, everybody hears that war story, it can make you or break you, the recruiting duty.

00:25:51.025 --> 00:25:56.105
<v SPEAKER_2>And the same can be said for the drill instructor, drill instructor duty as well.

00:25:56.145 --> 00:25:59.905
<v SPEAKER_1>I've heard recruiters say that drill instructors have it easy.

00:26:00.385 --> 00:26:03.005
<v SPEAKER_1>Everything is programmed for them.

00:26:03.025 --> 00:26:05.665
<v SPEAKER_1>They're on a tight structure, tight schedule.

00:26:05.985 --> 00:26:13.325
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, there's some creativity, but there's no real thought into what needs to get done.

00:26:15.005 --> 00:26:21.845
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't have an informed opinion of the matter, because I've never done either.

00:26:22.045 --> 00:26:32.425
<v SPEAKER_1>But I can understand that perspective, because for the recruiters, they've got to make mission every single month.

00:26:32.465 --> 00:26:37.105
<v SPEAKER_1>And you're only as good as the preceding month.

00:26:37.125 --> 00:26:46.825
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I think the most interaction I've probably had with some of those guys were like Advanced Academy, back at the Career Corps and Staff Academy and all that.

00:26:48.385 --> 00:26:52.705
<v SPEAKER_2>It's definitely, like you said, those stories, some of them are brutal.

00:26:52.925 --> 00:27:03.385
<v SPEAKER_2>But then you get some folks that, I guess, guys that can sail sand at the beach, you actually meet quite a few career recruiters at places like that too.

00:27:03.385 --> 00:27:09.105
<v SPEAKER_2>Some people end up liking it, but I think the majority would take it just as soon as they're here or take those orders to Afghanistan.

00:27:09.745 --> 00:27:15.545
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, going back, it's just kind of funny.

00:27:15.865 --> 00:27:19.725
<v SPEAKER_2>We were telling stories the other night, you know, when we were at the staff club wing knot.

00:27:19.745 --> 00:27:29.205
<v SPEAKER_2>I was thinking when I got home, Joe Farina, he's another one that, I guess, I think now he's what, is he a Lieutenant Colonel now?

00:27:30.025 --> 00:27:31.025
<v SPEAKER_1>Is he a Lieutenant Colonel?

00:27:31.185 --> 00:27:32.205
<v SPEAKER_2>Major Lieutenant Colonel.

00:27:32.705 --> 00:27:33.545
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know.

00:27:33.565 --> 00:27:34.525
<v SPEAKER_2>He's about to retire.

00:27:34.765 --> 00:27:35.085
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

00:27:35.165 --> 00:27:49.705
<v SPEAKER_2>I do know that, but, you know, as a young Lance Corporal, at 2nd Radio Battalion, going to the Mew.

00:27:50.705 --> 00:27:52.885
<v SPEAKER_1>So you were on a Mew with him?

00:27:53.125 --> 00:27:53.485
<v SPEAKER_2>I was.

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:55.425
<v SPEAKER_2>He ended up being in the AOIC.

00:27:55.445 --> 00:28:06.245
<v SPEAKER_2>So he had not, you know, he was Sergeant Farina, RRP, and then went through the program, came back as a Second Lieutenant to Battalion there.

00:28:06.265 --> 00:28:15.805
<v SPEAKER_2>And the first Mew that we were on, or that I went out on, I don't know, I picked up a lot from him, I think.

00:28:16.085 --> 00:28:16.585
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

00:28:17.565 --> 00:28:30.625
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, just again, you just got to keep putting that foot, one foot in front of the other, and keep moving forward, whether that be in your skill set game, in your people game, in your PT game, or whatnot.

00:28:31.245 --> 00:28:37.645
<v SPEAKER_2>One of the funny things he always used to say, you know, he'd come by and check to see what you, your team, your guys were up to that day.

00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:38.665
<v SPEAKER_1>What you're working on.

00:28:38.805 --> 00:28:40.305
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, what you're working on.

00:28:40.405 --> 00:28:56.685
<v SPEAKER_2>And his slogan was, because you know, you got to be improving, because while we're sitting here doing this, Osama Bin Laden is laid back doing flutter kicks hooked up to his kidney dialysis machine.

00:28:56.705 --> 00:28:58.045
<v SPEAKER_2>That's one of his slogans.

00:28:59.705 --> 00:29:01.845
<v SPEAKER_1>Flutter kicks on a kidney dialysis machine.

00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:02.405
<v SPEAKER_1>That's flutter.

00:29:02.425 --> 00:29:07.005
<v SPEAKER_2>Because the folks that you're going to find yourself up against, they ain't slowing down.

00:29:08.365 --> 00:29:11.285
<v SPEAKER_2>So I think a person just remember that.

00:29:12.185 --> 00:29:20.325
<v SPEAKER_2>You can't really slow your game down either, because the guys around you are brothers, but they're not going to slow their game down either.

00:29:21.445 --> 00:29:29.265
<v SPEAKER_2>So like you said a while ago, at some point, you're going to find yourself in competition with the guy next to you to an extent.

00:29:29.945 --> 00:29:44.665
<v SPEAKER_2>And just always trying to grow, like I said, whether it be personal, or I guess your knowledge and your skills and your job.

00:29:45.725 --> 00:29:49.065
<v SPEAKER_1>So how do you stay competitive, speaking on that?

00:29:51.105 --> 00:29:54.925
<v SPEAKER_2>Well, drinking this whiskey is probably not helping me.

00:29:54.945 --> 00:29:55.785
<v SPEAKER_2>It's better than beer.

00:29:55.805 --> 00:29:57.545
<v SPEAKER_2>No, that's true.

00:29:58.045 --> 00:30:01.365
<v SPEAKER_2>But I don't know.

00:30:01.385 --> 00:30:16.145
<v SPEAKER_2>I've really tried to, the farther we go along, oftentimes we see a lot of guys separate themselves from the group as far as talking like PTYs or what not, and not go out with the Marines every day.

00:30:16.385 --> 00:30:24.825
<v SPEAKER_2>Me and you had the conversation, I think you recently got back into really slinging it and going through the trenches with the Marines or what not.

00:30:24.845 --> 00:30:28.525
<v SPEAKER_2>But just try to keep that game up to an extent.

00:30:31.385 --> 00:30:48.445
<v SPEAKER_2>For, it's been a little easier for me to, I guess, in some aspects up until now, up to this point, it's been a little easier to stay a little bit ahead.

00:30:48.465 --> 00:30:51.205
<v SPEAKER_2>So I'm an elit guy by trade, right?

00:30:51.405 --> 00:30:51.705
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

00:30:52.385 --> 00:30:53.325
<v SPEAKER_2>We've obviously lost...

00:30:53.765 --> 00:30:54.225
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, right.

00:30:54.305 --> 00:31:01.445
<v SPEAKER_2>We've obviously lost faith and touch with what elit has been over the past several years.

00:31:01.965 --> 00:31:09.865
<v SPEAKER_2>But oftentimes, you know, we bring up a conversation and people are like, what are you talking about?

00:31:10.425 --> 00:31:16.685
<v SPEAKER_2>So just being able to stay relevant in that game, because it's going to be coming back around and be relevant again.

00:31:18.165 --> 00:31:22.385
<v SPEAKER_2>But going through the internship and...

00:31:22.905 --> 00:31:23.765
<v SPEAKER_1>So you did the internship.

00:31:23.785 --> 00:31:24.705
<v SPEAKER_1>You did in Moosep, too.

00:31:24.805 --> 00:31:25.185
<v SPEAKER_2>I did.

00:31:25.325 --> 00:31:33.665
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, so we followed the war train into the internship and then out here to Hawaii after that.

00:31:33.665 --> 00:31:35.005
<v SPEAKER_1>What made you decide to apply for that?

00:31:36.245 --> 00:31:42.005
<v SPEAKER_2>Chief Warrant Officer Molnar basically told me he was going to kick my ass if I didn't put in a package for it.

00:31:42.405 --> 00:31:43.985
<v SPEAKER_1>So I've met Molnar.

00:31:44.765 --> 00:31:45.725
<v SPEAKER_1>I think you could take him.

00:31:46.125 --> 00:31:46.465
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah?

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:48.145
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know.

00:31:49.025 --> 00:31:49.505
<v SPEAKER_2>We'll see.

00:31:49.765 --> 00:31:51.345
<v SPEAKER_2>Next time we run into him, we might lay down.

00:31:51.365 --> 00:31:53.065
<v SPEAKER_1>He seems scrappy, but I think you could take him.

00:31:53.085 --> 00:31:54.645
<v SPEAKER_2>He's a great guy.

00:31:54.665 --> 00:31:55.545
<v SPEAKER_2>I've known him for a long time.

00:31:55.565 --> 00:32:04.145
<v SPEAKER_2>He was one of the instructors in the schoolhouse down there when I came through and kept on and off, touched with him over the years.

00:32:04.165 --> 00:32:05.185
<v SPEAKER_1>He seems like a solid dude.

00:32:05.285 --> 00:32:07.465
<v SPEAKER_1>I met him for the first time recently in San Angelo.

00:32:07.485 --> 00:32:11.925
<v SPEAKER_1>We were out there doing a learning analysis for the 2691 MOS producing course.

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:26.425
<v SPEAKER_1>And him and Chief Warrant Officer Mush, apparently they were like the heavyweight champions of Jumbo Jenga, right?

00:32:26.465 --> 00:32:41.245
<v SPEAKER_1>At this little spot that I guess traditionally our counterparts head out to whenever there's a big conference or working group taking place in San Angelo.

00:32:41.665 --> 00:32:45.905
<v SPEAKER_1>So they go to this spot, and they've got the Jenga blocks all set up.

00:32:47.485 --> 00:32:54.445
<v SPEAKER_1>And it became kind of like a Chief Warrant Officer versus Master Sergeant competition.

00:32:55.525 --> 00:33:08.205
<v SPEAKER_1>And I guess the challenge, the gauntlet was thrown down sometime early during the TAD that Monar and Mush were undefeated.

00:33:08.465 --> 00:33:09.385
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, they're the champs.

00:33:09.385 --> 00:33:09.805
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

00:33:11.645 --> 00:33:12.925
<v SPEAKER_2>You let everybody know, too.

00:33:12.945 --> 00:33:14.325
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh, yeah, they let everybody know.

00:33:15.225 --> 00:33:16.685
<v SPEAKER_1>They may mention about it several times.

00:33:16.705 --> 00:33:25.245
<v SPEAKER_1>And of course, Marines being Marines and Master Sergeant being Master Sergeant, Skaggs and Simmons stepped up to the plate.

00:33:25.285 --> 00:33:28.445
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, here we go.

00:33:28.505 --> 00:33:37.345
<v SPEAKER_1>And so I'll hold off on the reveal of how it played out, but suffice to say that they're no longer undefeated.

00:33:37.545 --> 00:33:38.445
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

00:33:43.925 --> 00:33:44.625
<v SPEAKER_2>I really like him.

00:33:44.645 --> 00:33:48.005
<v SPEAKER_2>He's a solid individual, solid Marine.

00:33:49.885 --> 00:33:55.205
<v SPEAKER_2>Out there after he came back from Afghanistan, they...

00:33:55.305 --> 00:33:58.245
<v SPEAKER_2>Cherry Point's a difficult place for us 26s.

00:33:58.685 --> 00:34:02.165
<v SPEAKER_1>I've never done a tour with the Wing, so I can't call it...

00:34:02.645 --> 00:34:03.765
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm not a huge fan.

00:34:05.465 --> 00:34:13.625
<v SPEAKER_2>The relationships out there tend to be a bit different, but with the air crews and stuff like that.

00:34:13.645 --> 00:34:21.765
<v SPEAKER_2>But either way, after he came back, he actually was OIC for Q3 for the Sagan guys.

00:34:21.785 --> 00:34:25.645
<v SPEAKER_2>And I was a staffing OIC, so I got the opportunity to work with him for a couple of years.

00:34:26.245 --> 00:34:31.525
<v SPEAKER_2>And I really enjoyed it.

00:34:33.285 --> 00:34:35.405
<v SPEAKER_2>He's a good people person.

00:34:36.945 --> 00:34:41.185
<v SPEAKER_2>Kind of a funny guy, so to speak, as in make a lot of...

00:34:41.805 --> 00:34:45.765
<v SPEAKER_2>If a situation is bad, he's going to be the one to make a lot of it.

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:50.045
<v SPEAKER_2>And I think all the Marines really look up to him.

00:34:52.145 --> 00:34:52.905
<v SPEAKER_2>So I definitely took...

00:34:53.765 --> 00:34:54.865
<v SPEAKER_2>I can add him to the list.

00:34:54.925 --> 00:34:58.025
<v SPEAKER_2>He definitely took a lot of things from him as well.

00:35:00.005 --> 00:35:05.965
<v SPEAKER_1>So speaking of the Chief Foreign Officers, why did you not put a package in for the Chief Foreign Officer program?

00:35:06.065 --> 00:35:10.065
<v SPEAKER_1>You look at Joyce and you're smiling, and she's giving you this grin that's going from ear to ear.

00:35:10.285 --> 00:35:13.305
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, Joyce is laughing at me about this one.

00:35:13.385 --> 00:35:14.465
<v SPEAKER_2>So she really wanted me to.

00:35:16.005 --> 00:35:19.125
<v SPEAKER_2>Her brothers all recommended that I do it as well.

00:35:20.425 --> 00:35:33.725
<v SPEAKER_1>But to be honest, not to shoot holes in their game, but they don't really know what a Chief Foreign Officer is and what a Mass Sergeant is, at least in our occupational field.

00:35:33.745 --> 00:35:34.785
<v SPEAKER_2>No, I think that's very true.

00:35:34.805 --> 00:35:47.905
<v SPEAKER_2>Because we are the Marine Corps, but our game does play, you know, our game plays a little different than your average five-card draw in the Marine Corps.

00:35:47.925 --> 00:36:08.785
<v SPEAKER_2>But the, you know, I don't know, I went through MOSAP, through the internship program, and traditionally, a lot of the Marines that had been through that program did put in more officer packages, either directly after or, you know, or as soon as they did their three-year payback.

00:36:09.325 --> 00:36:12.805
<v SPEAKER_2>And I came down here, still a little bit undecided.

00:36:13.105 --> 00:36:13.425
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

00:36:13.845 --> 00:36:16.505
<v SPEAKER_2>And I talked with the Master Guns Bergeron.

00:36:19.625 --> 00:36:23.105
<v SPEAKER_2>He wasn't, you know, he said, it's kind of up to you, whatever you want to do.

00:36:23.265 --> 00:36:33.485
<v SPEAKER_2>But he said he could sure use, because that had happened so heavily, he said in his mind, he felt like we could use somebody staying on the enlisted side, you know, in the Master Art Realm.

00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:33.825
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

00:36:35.245 --> 00:36:37.005
<v SPEAKER_2>That had came through the program as well.

00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:39.085
<v SPEAKER_2>Me and Joyce talked about it.

00:36:39.585 --> 00:36:40.665
<v SPEAKER_2>She was kind of up for it.

00:36:43.225 --> 00:36:44.745
<v SPEAKER_1>But what was the determining factor?

00:36:46.065 --> 00:36:47.765
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know.

00:36:47.845 --> 00:37:13.905
<v SPEAKER_2>When I got, as we changed the game, and I saw that I had a pretty good shot at the Master Art Realm, I did not, I would really play my skill set in my game from, like you said, from the E8, the enlisted side, versus where the Chief Warrant Officers in our field go.

00:37:15.925 --> 00:37:20.605
<v SPEAKER_2>Because initially, you're going to come back from Wobbitt, and you're probably going to be the simo for one.

00:37:21.645 --> 00:37:22.965
<v SPEAKER_2>There's nothing wrong with that.

00:37:24.145 --> 00:37:30.825
<v SPEAKER_2>But you're going to start back at the bottom, and we'll save the bottom.

00:37:30.925 --> 00:37:38.705
<v SPEAKER_2>Like I said, it's something we've got to have, and I don't think there's really much more of a right person than at least the folks we've got here that have been involved in it.

00:37:39.105 --> 00:38:00.105
<v SPEAKER_2>But you're going to start down there, and then the interaction, I felt like I would have a more direct influence, a more direct interaction with the Marines, staying on the black side, with the Master Hunter route.

00:38:00.125 --> 00:38:02.865
<v SPEAKER_2>And again, like I said earlier, I'm kind of a people person.

00:38:02.985 --> 00:38:10.905
<v SPEAKER_2>I like having a direct interaction with the Marines, because that's what it's all about.

00:38:10.925 --> 00:38:12.265
<v SPEAKER_2>It ain't really about how much I know.

00:38:12.285 --> 00:38:17.065
<v SPEAKER_2>It's about how much I know and can push along, pass along to them.

00:38:17.305 --> 00:38:18.685
<v SPEAKER_2>That's kind of what really makes it play.

00:38:19.485 --> 00:38:25.645
<v SPEAKER_2>I just felt like I would have more opportunities, and that was a little better for me.

00:38:28.245 --> 00:38:31.205
<v SPEAKER_1>Did you ever drop Fs on any fitness report?

00:38:31.565 --> 00:38:32.525
<v SPEAKER_2>Absolutely not.

00:38:33.505 --> 00:38:34.385
<v SPEAKER_2>Absolutely not.

00:38:34.565 --> 00:38:35.265
<v SPEAKER_2>I think we had this.

00:38:35.505 --> 00:38:37.245
<v SPEAKER_2>Me and you were talking about this the other day a little bit.

00:38:38.205 --> 00:38:39.365
<v SPEAKER_2>It took me a long time.

00:38:39.565 --> 00:38:40.665
<v SPEAKER_2>I'll put it this way.

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:43.405
<v SPEAKER_2>It took me a long time to appreciate the rank of first sergeant.

00:38:44.005 --> 00:38:44.365
<v SPEAKER_1>Really?

00:38:44.485 --> 00:38:44.845
<v SPEAKER_2>It did.

00:38:44.965 --> 00:38:45.745
<v SPEAKER_2>It absolutely did.

00:38:46.505 --> 00:38:47.505
<v SPEAKER_2>Joyce can probably tell you.

00:38:47.545 --> 00:38:55.365
<v SPEAKER_1>So who was that single person that made that impact upon you to change your mindset?

00:38:56.945 --> 00:38:58.705
<v SPEAKER_2>It's actually been real recently.

00:38:59.765 --> 00:39:02.825
<v SPEAKER_2>It was actually here at this battalion, to be honest with you.

00:39:03.685 --> 00:39:06.585
<v SPEAKER_2>And I can't really say one in particular, but a couple.

00:39:06.605 --> 00:39:07.805
<v SPEAKER_2>And I can definitely name those.

00:39:08.165 --> 00:39:14.305
<v SPEAKER_2>First Sergeant Woodby, Amitep Woodby, and First Sergeant Ramos, Alfonso Ramos.

00:39:14.325 --> 00:39:16.045
<v SPEAKER_2>You probably met him maybe last year.

00:39:16.665 --> 00:39:18.025
<v SPEAKER_1>I did meet Ramos.

00:39:18.885 --> 00:39:20.325
<v SPEAKER_1>And I do know Woodby.

00:39:21.005 --> 00:39:22.205
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I think they've had...

00:39:25.165 --> 00:39:33.105
<v SPEAKER_2>So as they came into battalion here, I had just came into staffing CIC for the 31st MUDET out of here.

00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:37.465
<v SPEAKER_2>And that's a lot more of a company gunny type First Sergeant role.

00:39:37.785 --> 00:39:41.085
<v SPEAKER_2>You find yourself doing a lot more of those tasks as a gunny.

00:39:43.185 --> 00:39:44.125
<v SPEAKER_2>Then it really is...

00:39:47.545 --> 00:39:50.745
<v SPEAKER_2>There's as much of that as there is operational standpoint, to put it that way.

00:39:50.765 --> 00:39:50.985
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

00:39:51.345 --> 00:39:58.565
<v SPEAKER_2>And I'm talking with them all the time, whether it be the phone, the email.

00:39:58.925 --> 00:40:05.505
<v SPEAKER_2>And then when we got back here, working through issues that some of the Marines had or whatnot, and actually getting to sit down with them.

00:40:06.865 --> 00:40:10.505
<v SPEAKER_2>And while I was out there, I actually enjoyed some of that.

00:40:10.785 --> 00:40:13.165
<v SPEAKER_2>Whereas I thought, you know, I'm an operational guy.

00:40:13.185 --> 00:40:18.085
<v SPEAKER_2>I like, let's go do some Sig Ants, some Elant, whatnot, you know.

00:40:18.105 --> 00:40:21.625
<v SPEAKER_2>But I actually enjoyed that a little more.

00:40:22.065 --> 00:40:27.225
<v SPEAKER_2>And really, I guess it kind of drove home where I needed to be.

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:34.985
<v SPEAKER_2>So I think if I was going to give advice, I think you could be a blend of that and be better off.

00:40:35.505 --> 00:40:42.465
<v SPEAKER_1>I've always, and I said this probably to a fault when I was in the schoolhouse in St.

00:40:42.485 --> 00:40:42.905
<v SPEAKER_1>Angelo.

00:40:42.965 --> 00:40:47.325
<v SPEAKER_1>You gotta be a little bit of first sergeant, you gotta be a little bit of mass sergeant as you're coming up in the ranks.

00:40:47.505 --> 00:40:48.785
<v SPEAKER_1>It can't be either or.

00:40:51.025 --> 00:41:03.425
<v SPEAKER_1>For me, the first sergeant that had me thinking about dropping Fs, even back when I was a sergeant, was first sergeant Holler.

00:41:03.825 --> 00:41:05.145
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh yeah, first sergeant Holler.

00:41:05.465 --> 00:41:20.385
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, he had just checked in the battalion, and that son of a bitch, he sat down with every single Marine and Alpha Company and ground fought with all of us, back to back.

00:41:21.085 --> 00:41:23.645
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh yeah, he was thankful for something.

00:41:23.665 --> 00:41:28.585
<v SPEAKER_2>Joyce has an interesting story with first sergeant Holler.

00:41:28.605 --> 00:41:30.345
<v SPEAKER_2>She got yelled at for walking on the grass.

00:41:32.245 --> 00:41:33.405
<v SPEAKER_1>Stay off the grass.

00:41:33.425 --> 00:41:38.465
<v SPEAKER_3>I had no clue where the freaking guy was coming from either.

00:41:38.485 --> 00:41:39.725
<v SPEAKER_2>He could sit in his office area.

00:41:39.745 --> 00:41:41.305
<v SPEAKER_2>It was like he had eyes in the back of his head.

00:41:41.845 --> 00:41:43.105
<v SPEAKER_2>He had that front office.

00:41:43.125 --> 00:41:48.085
<v SPEAKER_2>Get off my grass!

00:41:49.365 --> 00:41:50.505
<v SPEAKER_2>I would agree with you.

00:41:50.525 --> 00:41:54.685
<v SPEAKER_2>I think he was definitely a good man.

00:41:55.865 --> 00:42:00.045
<v SPEAKER_2>At that time, I probably wasn't even thinking a lot.

00:42:00.445 --> 00:42:04.425
<v SPEAKER_2>Thinking along those lines too much back then when I was working there for him.

00:42:05.325 --> 00:42:25.485
<v SPEAKER_1>You may not know this, but I came in at 23, so by the time I was a sergeant, was it almost a little over three years in, I was 26, a little bit older than the average sergeant in the Marine Corps at the time, or at least newly promoted sergeant.

00:42:26.725 --> 00:42:43.465
<v SPEAKER_1>And to a certain extent, my understanding of the gun club was centered on the fact that I was going to do this until I couldn't do it anymore.

00:42:44.785 --> 00:43:10.325
<v SPEAKER_1>And so I learned quickly to assess, identify, select, recruit, and retain solid mentors because I knew that that was how I was going to be a more effective leader, a better Marine.

00:43:11.205 --> 00:43:21.065
<v SPEAKER_1>And First Sergeant Holler was one of those guys that I latched on to quickly and was always growing up, I would say, peeping game.

00:43:25.645 --> 00:43:45.625
<v SPEAKER_1>Getting those observations, those lessons learned that I thought I needed to have in order to be an effective leader because the last dude I want to be is that Sergeant or that Staff Sergeant or just that Marine that the junior Marines looked up to and dismissed completely.

00:43:48.585 --> 00:44:04.005
<v SPEAKER_1>To a certain extent, I had a certain amount of professional paranoia to be incompetent because I'd seen that enough to know that that's not who I am, that's not who my father raised me to be, that's not who my mother raised me to be.

00:44:04.025 --> 00:44:19.185
<v SPEAKER_1>I come from a family that takes a certain amount of pride in not only your name, but your work ethic, and I kind of took that to heart.

00:44:19.525 --> 00:44:22.625
<v SPEAKER_1>I kind of saw JD.

00:44:22.645 --> 00:44:26.425
<v SPEAKER_1>Holder as being one of those guys to kind of help me along those lines.

00:44:26.825 --> 00:44:33.265
<v SPEAKER_1>But there were Master Sergeant and Master Guns that were at the battalion around that same time frame that I learned from as well.

00:44:33.965 --> 00:44:37.925
<v SPEAKER_1>Guys like Master Guns Hartman.

00:44:38.345 --> 00:44:38.705
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh yeah.

00:44:39.685 --> 00:44:44.445
<v SPEAKER_1>And of course Master Gunny Owen, AKA Gecko.

00:44:46.785 --> 00:44:47.945
<v SPEAKER_1>Really good man.

00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:49.565
<v SPEAKER_2>We had a run in here a while back.

00:44:50.465 --> 00:44:50.725
<v SPEAKER_1>Who?

00:44:51.045 --> 00:44:52.085
<v SPEAKER_2>Me and Master Guns Owen.

00:44:52.105 --> 00:44:54.065
<v SPEAKER_2>So this is a funny story.

00:44:54.245 --> 00:44:56.465
<v SPEAKER_2>But I still CGRI.

00:44:57.065 --> 00:44:59.145
<v SPEAKER_2>And it's been a few years.

00:44:59.985 --> 00:45:02.725
<v SPEAKER_2>And Bravo's.

00:45:03.325 --> 00:45:04.785
<v SPEAKER_2>My tie was a little bit too long.

00:45:05.365 --> 00:45:09.305
<v SPEAKER_2>And we did this like the first day, maybe the second morning.

00:45:10.365 --> 00:45:13.625
<v SPEAKER_2>And he let me have it all week about having my tie too long.

00:45:13.985 --> 00:45:14.545
<v SPEAKER_1>Too long?

00:45:14.785 --> 00:45:15.565
<v SPEAKER_1>How long was it?

00:45:16.225 --> 00:45:17.085
<v SPEAKER_2>It was too long.

00:45:17.785 --> 00:45:19.505
<v SPEAKER_2>But by the time I realized.

00:45:19.525 --> 00:45:21.965
<v SPEAKER_2>You didn't answer my question.

00:45:22.945 --> 00:45:30.445
<v SPEAKER_2>By the time that I ended up getting there, I was in a class as well as in the program out there.

00:45:31.185 --> 00:45:32.185
<v SPEAKER_2>But I was in a class.

00:45:33.065 --> 00:45:38.485
<v SPEAKER_2>By the time I came over there, I legitimately was going to re-tie the knot.

00:45:39.865 --> 00:45:42.245
<v SPEAKER_2>And there's a big old kink right here.

00:45:42.465 --> 00:45:47.025
<v SPEAKER_2>So when I adjusted it, basically it wasn't flat and smooth.

00:45:47.345 --> 00:45:57.245
<v SPEAKER_2>So I took the gamble of a smooth and pressed tie a little bit long or proper length and kind of jacked up and quirky looking.

00:45:58.625 --> 00:46:01.265
<v SPEAKER_2>I wouldn't have been able to get either one of them by.

00:46:01.605 --> 00:46:03.805
<v SPEAKER_2>It's fine, but no, it's just a funny story.

00:46:03.825 --> 00:46:08.385
<v SPEAKER_1>So you're one of those Marines that keeps your tie not intact?

00:46:08.485 --> 00:46:10.345
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh yeah, way more than I should.

00:46:10.865 --> 00:46:11.505
<v SPEAKER_1>So not me.

00:46:12.105 --> 00:46:12.905
<v SPEAKER_2>You tie it every time?

00:46:12.925 --> 00:46:13.705
<v SPEAKER_1>I tie it every time.

00:46:14.325 --> 00:46:23.985
<v SPEAKER_1>But bear in mind, the years that I was with DIA and doing that embassy tour, I was wearing a suit and tie every day.

00:46:24.325 --> 00:46:27.485
<v SPEAKER_1>And so for me, it's just like butter.

00:46:27.505 --> 00:46:28.125
<v SPEAKER_1>It's just smooth.

00:46:30.245 --> 00:46:31.925
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I could use some practice.

00:46:31.945 --> 00:46:38.025
<v SPEAKER_2>I might have to get my ties out and practice a little bit.

00:46:38.045 --> 00:46:38.325
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

00:46:40.185 --> 00:46:44.885
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, I think you're at something you said a minute ago.

00:46:44.905 --> 00:46:53.585
<v SPEAKER_2>I kind of struck a little chord talking about not wanting to be somebody that the Marines look up to and then completely write off, because we all know those people.

00:46:53.585 --> 00:46:54.745
<v SPEAKER_2>We know way too many of them.

00:46:54.765 --> 00:46:55.985
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I was telling this to Sonny.

00:46:55.985 --> 00:47:03.785
<v SPEAKER_1>There was a Mass Sergeant at that career course when I was a Staff Sergeant that told me, the Marines are always looking at you for a sign of weakness.

00:47:04.165 --> 00:47:04.505
<v SPEAKER_1>Oh yeah.

00:47:04.525 --> 00:47:07.065
<v SPEAKER_1>And it's up to you to determine what you show them and what you don't.

00:47:07.585 --> 00:47:21.985
<v SPEAKER_1>You can show them that you're human, and you make mistakes, and you correct them, but it instilled in me a certain amount of professional paranoia.

00:47:22.185 --> 00:47:23.345
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, no, absolutely.

00:47:23.365 --> 00:47:31.645
<v SPEAKER_2>So me and Nick Watson, we were talking about this just the other day, and I think if it don't hold true, I think it should hold true.

00:47:33.005 --> 00:47:47.805
<v SPEAKER_2>If there is something that keeps you up at night, it ought to be worried that you're, you know, that knowing that you're in the spot where they can't question you.

00:47:48.005 --> 00:47:48.865
<v SPEAKER_2>You know what I mean?

00:47:48.885 --> 00:47:50.085
<v SPEAKER_2>You know what you're talking about.

00:47:50.285 --> 00:47:54.865
<v SPEAKER_2>You're not giving it, because hey, those junior Marines, they're like a pack of wild dogs.

00:47:54.985 --> 00:47:56.465
<v SPEAKER_2>They'll eat you alive.

00:47:56.665 --> 00:48:00.545
<v SPEAKER_2>If you show them a weakness, they're going to start hacking on it.

00:48:02.925 --> 00:48:04.525
<v SPEAKER_1>Sharks in the water that smell blood.

00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:07.025
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, and that's one of the things he said.

00:48:07.425 --> 00:48:14.745
<v SPEAKER_2>He said, that's the only thing that ever bothers me is just being afraid.

00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:17.645
<v SPEAKER_2>Did you leave a gap in your game?

00:48:17.985 --> 00:48:21.885
<v SPEAKER_2>Did you leave a weak spot in your game's defenses, basically?

00:48:22.865 --> 00:48:30.345
<v SPEAKER_2>And that's why I say, you know, just trying to always keep up with the times, keep up with what's going on.

00:48:30.845 --> 00:48:31.925
<v SPEAKER_1>So how do you keep up?

00:48:32.865 --> 00:48:33.765
<v SPEAKER_1>What are you reading?

00:48:33.785 --> 00:48:35.005
<v SPEAKER_1>What are you listening to?

00:48:35.025 --> 00:48:35.785
<v SPEAKER_1>What are you watching?

00:48:35.805 --> 00:48:36.825
<v SPEAKER_1>What are you studying?

00:48:37.685 --> 00:48:40.765
<v SPEAKER_2>I would say I'm watching the news, but I recently stopped watching the news.

00:48:41.005 --> 00:48:41.465
<v SPEAKER_1>Why's that?

00:48:41.505 --> 00:48:52.045
<v SPEAKER_2>Because I came home and I'm not big on the news these days because all the arguing over stuff that, in my opinion, in my mind, it really doesn't...

00:48:52.765 --> 00:48:54.165
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, maybe it does matter.

00:48:54.345 --> 00:48:55.765
<v SPEAKER_2>The subject matters.

00:48:56.205 --> 00:48:59.045
<v SPEAKER_2>But the arguments don't make any difference.

00:48:59.065 --> 00:49:00.425
<v SPEAKER_2>Because they're going to argue whether it's...

00:49:00.465 --> 00:49:03.045
<v SPEAKER_2>You can come up with the politics and the...

00:49:03.065 --> 00:49:03.805
<v SPEAKER_2>The politics, yeah.

00:49:03.825 --> 00:49:05.445
<v SPEAKER_2>They're going to argue whether we're going one way.

00:49:05.665 --> 00:49:07.545
<v SPEAKER_2>Somebody else is going to argue we're going this way.

00:49:08.085 --> 00:49:10.545
<v SPEAKER_2>So I've kind of just stopped that.

00:49:10.565 --> 00:49:11.245
<v SPEAKER_2>I get all my...

00:49:12.485 --> 00:49:13.225
<v SPEAKER_2>The early bird.

00:49:13.805 --> 00:49:15.385
<v SPEAKER_2>I get the early bird updates.

00:49:15.405 --> 00:49:18.005
<v SPEAKER_2>That keeps me up to speed on anything that...

00:49:18.025 --> 00:49:19.805
<v SPEAKER_2>On the most of the stuff that I really care about.

00:49:19.925 --> 00:49:20.765
<v SPEAKER_1>What's the early bird?

00:49:21.285 --> 00:49:21.685
<v SPEAKER_2>This is...

00:49:22.245 --> 00:49:24.085
<v SPEAKER_2>Every morning, I forget who even puts it out now.

00:49:24.405 --> 00:49:26.225
<v SPEAKER_2>We used to be able to get it on the computers at work.

00:49:26.685 --> 00:49:26.945
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay.

00:49:28.185 --> 00:49:29.325
<v SPEAKER_2>It's an email that they send.

00:49:29.345 --> 00:49:30.305
<v SPEAKER_2>My personal email now.

00:49:32.345 --> 00:49:34.005
<v SPEAKER_2>You can Google search early bird.

00:49:34.145 --> 00:49:39.885
<v SPEAKER_2>It's going to keep all the military, defense-type politics stuff.

00:49:39.905 --> 00:49:42.285
<v SPEAKER_2>It's going to spit out articles every morning.

00:49:42.585 --> 00:49:44.665
<v SPEAKER_2>That's where I get my news from nowadays.

00:49:47.345 --> 00:49:50.525
<v SPEAKER_2>But I read a lot.

00:49:50.625 --> 00:49:54.445
<v SPEAKER_2>I probably don't read a lot of history.

00:49:54.585 --> 00:49:55.625
<v SPEAKER_1>What do you read now?

00:49:56.085 --> 00:49:56.565
<v SPEAKER_2>Right now?

00:49:56.565 --> 00:49:56.965
<v SPEAKER_1>Right now.

00:49:57.305 --> 00:50:00.025
<v SPEAKER_2>I got two books in the works.

00:50:00.345 --> 00:50:00.805
<v SPEAKER_1>Two books?

00:50:00.985 --> 00:50:01.985
<v SPEAKER_1>Two books.

00:50:02.525 --> 00:50:09.845
<v SPEAKER_2>One of them is, I'm a little bit behind the times here, but a book called Killing Pablo, about the hunt for Pablo Escobar.

00:50:10.125 --> 00:50:14.725
<v SPEAKER_2>I've had it in my Amazon shopping cart for years because it's a...

00:50:15.085 --> 00:50:15.665
<v SPEAKER_1>Mark Bowden.

00:50:15.925 --> 00:50:16.665
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, Mark Bowden.

00:50:16.685 --> 00:50:17.005
<v SPEAKER_2>It's a...

00:50:17.865 --> 00:50:21.725
<v SPEAKER_2>A lot of folks in the community, you know, talk pretty highly on the book.

00:50:22.105 --> 00:50:23.405
<v SPEAKER_2>So I've had it in there for a long time.

00:50:23.745 --> 00:50:25.925
<v SPEAKER_2>I just never had got it.

00:50:25.945 --> 00:50:28.145
<v SPEAKER_2>So it came in this past week.

00:50:28.145 --> 00:50:28.765
<v SPEAKER_2>I picked it up.

00:50:28.985 --> 00:50:31.465
<v SPEAKER_2>I've read, I don't know, I'm a third way through it or so.

00:50:31.845 --> 00:50:32.585
<v SPEAKER_2>Read that one.

00:50:32.605 --> 00:50:35.765
<v SPEAKER_2>Then I'm reading a...

00:50:38.345 --> 00:50:38.905
<v SPEAKER_2>What is the name?

00:50:38.925 --> 00:50:40.025
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't even know the name of the book.

00:50:40.265 --> 00:50:41.145
<v SPEAKER_2>It's got BJ.

00:50:44.605 --> 00:50:45.365
<v SPEAKER_2>He's some kind of...

00:50:45.865 --> 00:50:48.305
<v SPEAKER_2>If you ever watch the show Longmire on TV, it's similar.

00:50:48.705 --> 00:50:49.225
<v SPEAKER_2>Longmire?

00:50:49.305 --> 00:50:50.645
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

00:50:50.885 --> 00:50:52.085
<v SPEAKER_2>He's a game warden in Wyoming.

00:50:52.265 --> 00:50:53.205
<v SPEAKER_2>It's a fiction book.

00:50:53.825 --> 00:51:02.305
<v SPEAKER_2>But I read a lot of Westerns, Western history, cowboys, Indian stories, pushing cows up the trail.

00:51:02.325 --> 00:51:02.785
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know.

00:51:02.805 --> 00:51:04.145
<v SPEAKER_2>It just helps me decompress, I guess.

00:51:04.865 --> 00:51:17.345
<v SPEAKER_1>But we talked a little bit of this off mic, and I kind of want to circle back to it because I think it will paint a solid picture of who Darry Cross is.

00:51:19.545 --> 00:51:32.045
<v SPEAKER_1>We were talking about the Western movie genre, and I explained that me growing up in Texas, my grandparents, Tilo and Lencha, they had five children.

00:51:32.785 --> 00:51:34.125
<v SPEAKER_1>The first four were boys.

00:51:34.945 --> 00:51:42.445
<v SPEAKER_1>Their first five grandsons, within a time span of about four or five years, were all boys.

00:51:43.405 --> 00:51:52.825
<v SPEAKER_1>We used to spend long weekends and summers up there with Tilo and Lencha, and he'd always throw a Western on, and we'd watch it.

00:51:52.845 --> 00:51:57.085
<v SPEAKER_1>Some of my favorites were The Cowboys and The Sons of Katie Elder.

00:51:59.065 --> 00:52:02.885
<v SPEAKER_1>Occasionally, he'd watch some of the TV shows like Gunsmoke and you name it.

00:52:03.865 --> 00:52:07.805
<v SPEAKER_1>But these new generation Westerns, they're a little bit different, huh?

00:52:08.005 --> 00:52:08.565
<v SPEAKER_2>They're tough.

00:52:08.585 --> 00:52:09.385
<v SPEAKER_2>They're hard to keep up.

00:52:10.425 --> 00:52:11.825
<v SPEAKER_2>They've got to really bring their A game.

00:52:12.065 --> 00:52:32.325
<v SPEAKER_2>When we were talking, I said, I think one of the reasons it's so hard for them to make an actually good Western nowadays is because the general population in society, especially in America, for the most part, a large percentage are so far removed from that world.

00:52:34.385 --> 00:52:37.105
<v SPEAKER_2>It's just hard for them to keep up.

00:52:37.185 --> 00:52:39.025
<v SPEAKER_2>Every once in a while, we come across a good one, though.

00:52:39.225 --> 00:52:39.485
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

00:52:39.545 --> 00:52:43.065
<v SPEAKER_1>So what do you think about military movies?

00:52:43.085 --> 00:52:46.265
<v SPEAKER_2>Military movies, I would say they're a little bit more difficult.

00:52:46.825 --> 00:52:48.025
<v SPEAKER_2>The action is still action.

00:52:48.305 --> 00:52:48.885
<v SPEAKER_2>It's still good.

00:52:49.265 --> 00:52:53.445
<v SPEAKER_2>But I think we can kind of catch things a lot of times that we know are...

00:52:54.265 --> 00:52:55.705
<v SPEAKER_2>Things don't necessarily play that way.

00:52:56.565 --> 00:53:01.805
<v SPEAKER_1>So what have you seen that you thought was dead on accurate?

00:53:02.325 --> 00:53:03.245
<v SPEAKER_2>Dead on accurate?

00:53:04.585 --> 00:53:08.125
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, now you're gonna put me on the spot here.

00:53:08.145 --> 00:53:10.725
<v SPEAKER_2>They want some good new ones.

00:53:16.833 --> 00:53:19.573
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm trying to think the last military movie I actually watched.

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:25.893
<v SPEAKER_2>Let's see, we watched Lone Survivor.

00:53:25.913 --> 00:53:27.573
<v SPEAKER_1>What did you think about that?

00:53:27.913 --> 00:53:28.993
<v SPEAKER_2>I thought it was a pretty good movie.

00:53:29.233 --> 00:53:29.853
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

00:53:29.993 --> 00:53:38.253
<v SPEAKER_2>I think, you know, it's not all the guts and glory or what not, you know.

00:53:38.513 --> 00:53:51.433
<v SPEAKER_2>There's a lot of sadness and loss, you know, honor stuff that goes, that, you know, it kind of goes along with our game, too, if you get put in those types of situations.

00:53:52.273 --> 00:53:54.973
<v SPEAKER_2>I thought it was a great movie, you know, it had a lot of action to it.

00:53:55.373 --> 00:54:07.273
<v SPEAKER_2>But then at the end, it's one of those movies that, when they start playing the pictures, you know, the pictures of the actual people, it's hard not to fight, you know, kind of fight the, maybe a little bit of tear trickling out of the corner.

00:54:07.293 --> 00:54:07.813
<v SPEAKER_2>Right, right.

00:54:08.513 --> 00:54:12.853
<v SPEAKER_2>Because, yeah, we watch it, we think it's just a movie, but somebody lived that.

00:54:13.493 --> 00:54:29.893
<v SPEAKER_2>And obviously, I'm sure there are probably portions that they may have dramatized or beefed up a little bit for the movie portion, but I think they did a pretty good job portraying the, you know, the facts of losing your brother next to you.

00:54:30.213 --> 00:54:34.173
<v SPEAKER_1>If they ever made a movie about Darry Cross, who would be the actor?

00:54:34.433 --> 00:54:35.733
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, I don't know.

00:54:35.933 --> 00:54:38.693
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't have any of these young, new guy actors.

00:54:38.713 --> 00:54:41.013
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm not a big fan of them.

00:54:41.093 --> 00:54:42.253
<v SPEAKER_2>I can't pick Sam Elliott.

00:54:42.273 --> 00:54:43.173
<v SPEAKER_2>He's a little bit too old.

00:54:44.953 --> 00:54:47.553
<v SPEAKER_1>You don't have the mustache for Sam Elliott.

00:54:48.953 --> 00:54:53.493
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know who the best new guy would be.

00:54:53.513 --> 00:54:55.173
<v SPEAKER_2>What do you think, Joyce?

00:54:58.373 --> 00:54:58.973
<v SPEAKER_2>What's he play on?

00:55:03.933 --> 00:55:04.553
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know the guy.

00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:05.793
<v SPEAKER_2>He's at Eastwood.

00:55:06.453 --> 00:55:07.313
<v SPEAKER_2>Scott Eastwood.

00:55:07.393 --> 00:55:09.593
<v SPEAKER_2>Clint Eastwood is his son?

00:55:10.373 --> 00:55:11.593
<v SPEAKER_2>I'll take that as a compliment.

00:55:14.073 --> 00:55:15.073
<v SPEAKER_1>Scott Eastwood, huh?

00:55:15.753 --> 00:55:16.193
<v SPEAKER_1>Okay.

00:55:21.093 --> 00:55:35.833
<v SPEAKER_1>If you could go back in time to sit down mid-deployment with Sergeant Cross at the smoke pit, you wouldn't necessarily have to be smoking, because I know you're not a smoker.

00:55:35.853 --> 00:55:36.893
<v SPEAKER_1>You're a dipper.

00:55:37.993 --> 00:55:43.833
<v SPEAKER_1>But just to have that one-on-one time, let's say I give you two hours.

00:55:43.853 --> 00:55:48.193
<v SPEAKER_1>What are you going to tell them?

00:55:57.533 --> 00:56:08.013
<v SPEAKER_2>Probably maybe be a little bit more bold, a little bit more cocky is not the word I'm looking for, but have a little more self-confidence.

00:56:12.053 --> 00:56:31.053
<v SPEAKER_2>I've been put in situations and times that had I spoken, like I was talking about earlier, I've kind of always been sitting back in the corner, a person not big to speak up a lot of times, unless it's needed or the right time.

00:56:31.073 --> 00:56:39.073
<v SPEAKER_2>But if I was a little bit more forward, that would have brought forth a little bit more self-confidence, a little bit more outspokenness.

00:56:44.233 --> 00:56:47.053
<v SPEAKER_2>I would have gone back to our time together.

00:56:47.673 --> 00:56:48.533
<v SPEAKER_2>I would probably have...

00:56:56.019 --> 00:56:57.739
<v SPEAKER_2>I probably have pushed myself.

00:56:58.019 --> 00:57:00.679
<v SPEAKER_2>So back then, let's go back for a minute.

00:57:01.099 --> 00:57:06.099
<v SPEAKER_2>I was thinking pretty hard about, you know, they had just stood up the Marsau game.

00:57:06.119 --> 00:57:07.779
<v SPEAKER_2>You and I were talking about this a little bit the other night.

00:57:08.259 --> 00:57:30.379
<v SPEAKER_2>But I was probably a little bit timid in that move, but if I could go back to that point, what was that, 06 time frame, 07, I would have pushed myself a little bit harder to go that route, maybe get it.

00:57:31.299 --> 00:57:48.939
<v SPEAKER_2>And again, you know, I'm not, I just, like I said the other night, I think a lot of those guys that did go over there, you know, went the Marsauk route, I think they're going to be heavy hitters in our field for a long time to come.

00:57:48.959 --> 00:57:50.199
<v SPEAKER_1>Definitely, definitely.

00:57:50.439 --> 00:57:57.499
<v SPEAKER_2>And some of the opportunities that that route brings you, it's going to make you or break you.

00:57:57.639 --> 00:58:01.659
<v SPEAKER_2>You're either going to become a professional from it or it's going to burn you out and run you over.

00:58:03.979 --> 00:58:10.359
<v SPEAKER_2>Because they have more than their share of opportunities to put the game to work.

00:58:10.919 --> 00:58:12.219
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, I don't know.

00:58:14.299 --> 00:58:19.599
<v SPEAKER_2>I would have definitely went that, pushed myself to maybe go that route, give that a little bit more of a try.

00:58:21.799 --> 00:58:24.819
<v SPEAKER_1>So it sounds like there's a little bit of a regret there.

00:58:24.839 --> 00:58:25.419
<v SPEAKER_2>Maybe a little bit.

00:58:25.439 --> 00:58:26.399
<v SPEAKER_2>Sometimes I look back.

00:58:26.519 --> 00:58:44.719
<v SPEAKER_2>I think more recently I came to, you know, when you get to a senior gunny or now a newly promoted masterhunt, you know, when you get to this point, I don't think it's quite the same.

00:58:46.099 --> 00:58:52.299
<v SPEAKER_2>It's not quite as important or quite the difference or whatnot where we are now because we all got our own experiences.

00:58:52.859 --> 00:59:00.739
<v SPEAKER_2>But I would say if it's something you're interested in, do a little bit more looking into it than what I did.

00:59:01.179 --> 00:59:06.619
<v SPEAKER_2>Because I do sometimes wish that I had went over when a lot of those guys did.

00:59:06.639 --> 00:59:09.379
<v SPEAKER_2>We came back off that one float and probably, what?

00:59:10.059 --> 00:59:10.819
<v SPEAKER_1>2008.

00:59:10.919 --> 00:59:13.799
<v SPEAKER_2>2008, there was probably, how many of those guys went over?

00:59:13.819 --> 00:59:15.039
<v SPEAKER_2>Probably five or six.

00:59:15.979 --> 00:59:17.999
<v SPEAKER_2>Grosso was one of them.

00:59:18.019 --> 00:59:19.479
<v SPEAKER_2>And it wasn't all RRP.

00:59:19.719 --> 00:59:23.859
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, Ron Miller, that was the first float, but he went over right when we got back.

00:59:24.719 --> 00:59:29.199
<v SPEAKER_2>Master Guns Doucet, he went over right when we came back off that first...

00:59:29.219 --> 00:59:30.399
<v SPEAKER_1>Actually, Doucet was already over there.

00:59:30.419 --> 00:59:32.859
<v SPEAKER_1>When we were going out, they were actually attached to us.

00:59:33.019 --> 00:59:34.139
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.

00:59:34.219 --> 00:59:42.679
<v SPEAKER_2>So between that first float idea, that first deployment, and then the one where you and I were together, that's when, I guess, when most of the folks started really going over.

00:59:42.699 --> 00:59:44.339
<v SPEAKER_2>But, you know, I don't know.

00:59:45.099 --> 00:59:50.299
<v SPEAKER_2>At that time, it was probably, the way it ended up was probably better for me.

00:59:54.299 --> 01:00:03.019
<v SPEAKER_2>I had, I guess, on a personal level, on a family level, you know, we were kind of going through some things, and we got those orders down in Texas.

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:09.659
<v SPEAKER_2>I think that was one of the best things that happened for us to take us out of the, took us out of the situa-

01:00:10.219 --> 01:00:18.599
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, and took us out of the situation we were in at that time, which, you know, hanging out with some of the wrong people, people I shouldn't have been hanging out with.

01:00:19.239 --> 01:00:20.179
<v SPEAKER_1>Tell me about it.

01:00:20.399 --> 01:00:23.219
<v SPEAKER_2>It put us kind of on a little bit of a rough path for a little while, but-

01:00:23.239 --> 01:00:24.699
<v SPEAKER_2>You're talking about Marines?

01:00:25.899 --> 01:00:30.799
<v SPEAKER_2>Marines and just, you know, people even outside of work.

01:00:31.239 --> 01:00:32.359
<v SPEAKER_2>I say this quite a bit, but-

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:34.719
<v SPEAKER_1>Did you want to go to North Carolina or San Antonio?

01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:36.159
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh yeah, no, we were in North Carolina.

01:00:40.819 --> 01:00:57.059
<v SPEAKER_2>So, you can be a pretty damn good person, you know, and have a strong character, strong faith, or whatever word you want to describe it with, but if you hang around the wrong people long enough, they're going to start rubbing off on you.

01:00:57.079 --> 01:00:58.159
<v SPEAKER_1>Tell me who you walk with.

01:00:58.159 --> 01:00:59.219
<v SPEAKER_1>I'll tell you who you are.

01:00:59.219 --> 01:00:59.519
<v SPEAKER_2>Yep.

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:06.299
<v SPEAKER_2>It keeps bringing it coming up, but yeah, they-

01:01:06.319 --> 01:01:10.679
<v SPEAKER_1>So, with that, have you had to-

01:01:11.339 --> 01:01:26.199
<v SPEAKER_1>have you experienced and had to work through any adversity from a professional level, an adverse fit rep, problems with weight, high weight standards or-

01:01:26.959 --> 01:01:27.399
<v SPEAKER_2>No, I've-

01:01:27.819 --> 01:01:32.539
<v SPEAKER_1>Physical fitness or just maybe caustic leadership.

01:01:36.299 --> 01:01:36.959
<v SPEAKER_2>I've been fortunate.

01:01:36.979 --> 01:01:39.719
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, I've never had an adverse fit rep.

01:01:40.379 --> 01:01:41.639
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm not a great runner.

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:51.959
<v SPEAKER_2>Running's something that I have to do on my own in order to stay in the spots where I need to be.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:54.519
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm a line rider on the weight sometimes.

01:01:56.459 --> 01:02:05.999
<v SPEAKER_2>Probably the last, I don't know, five or six years, I'm take or give five pounds from Max.

01:02:06.719 --> 01:02:17.759
<v SPEAKER_2>And there's been a few weigh-ins that I had to go to the gym and sweat a little weight off my ass before I hit that scale a couple of times.

01:02:19.219 --> 01:02:20.899
<v SPEAKER_2>So I have had to work through that.

01:02:21.179 --> 01:02:26.899
<v SPEAKER_2>And it's definitely, it's not worth doing, it's not worth being miserable, you know what I mean?

01:02:27.079 --> 01:02:28.219
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:39.999
<v SPEAKER_2>If you have these guys that, some guys, beefcake dudes or whatever you want to call them, that play the tape game all the time, that's not for me.

01:02:40.019 --> 01:02:40.299
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

01:02:40.359 --> 01:02:50.259
<v SPEAKER_2>I would much rather, some body types, you really don't have much of a decision, especially when you start hitting 30s, have to work a little harder, and I'm sure it's going to continue.

01:02:50.659 --> 01:02:51.879
<v SPEAKER_1>Who are you talking to?

01:02:51.899 --> 01:02:53.239
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm in my 40s.

01:02:53.439 --> 01:02:55.079
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:02:55.199 --> 01:02:58.579
<v SPEAKER_2>But, you know, for me, it's not worth playing that game.

01:02:58.599 --> 01:03:06.879
<v SPEAKER_2>I'm fortunate enough to be able to keep myself, even though I'm close, fortunate enough to be able to keep myself to the left.

01:03:07.939 --> 01:03:08.979
<v SPEAKER_2>Caustic leadership.

01:03:09.939 --> 01:03:16.199
<v SPEAKER_2>I think you're going to run into those folks almost everywhere you go.

01:03:16.219 --> 01:03:24.499
<v SPEAKER_2>There's going to be somebody there that is on a different page than you are.

01:03:24.519 --> 01:03:38.419
<v SPEAKER_2>Whether it be one of those first sergeants like we were talking about earlier, whether it be the direct leadership, the master sergeant, the chief warrant officer, the officers you've got to work for.

01:03:41.759 --> 01:03:46.699
<v SPEAKER_2>I think there's going to be somebody there all the time, but that can be.

01:03:46.719 --> 01:03:52.699
<v SPEAKER_2>But again, for me anyway, just keep doing what I know how to do.

01:03:54.519 --> 01:04:01.179
<v SPEAKER_2>Try and make the best of situations, not to think.

01:04:02.299 --> 01:04:03.659
<v SPEAKER_2>Try and influence that person.

01:04:04.319 --> 01:04:14.699
<v SPEAKER_2>If you absolutely think they're wrong, or at least in my case, I'm going to try to sway them, to come more in the lane where I think we ought to be.

01:04:14.719 --> 01:04:18.239
<v SPEAKER_2>I had a lieutenant.

01:04:19.059 --> 01:04:19.879
<v SPEAKER_2>He's a great guy.

01:04:20.599 --> 01:04:27.799
<v SPEAKER_2>I worked for him for a little while, but his emotions drove him.

01:04:28.579 --> 01:04:31.799
<v SPEAKER_2>So he acted on emotion basically, we'll say.

01:04:32.439 --> 01:04:42.839
<v SPEAKER_2>And the dang sure wasn't going to play very well, so the lieutenant and the gunny had to sit down and have a chat because we're not the only ones to see that.

01:04:42.839 --> 01:04:45.019
<v SPEAKER_2>Those junior Marines definitely see it.

01:04:45.039 --> 01:04:50.519
<v SPEAKER_2>And they're going to be the ones, nine times out of ten, that are going to be more impressionable and pick up on that stuff.

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:51.499
<v SPEAKER_1>And they'll respond to it.

01:04:52.399 --> 01:04:53.199
<v SPEAKER_2>More so than we are.

01:04:53.219 --> 01:04:53.979
<v SPEAKER_1>It has an impact.

01:04:54.579 --> 01:05:01.539
<v SPEAKER_1>I learned something from the Coast Guard over the years.

01:05:02.719 --> 01:05:07.239
<v SPEAKER_1>I had a couple of Coast Guard attachés with me in Santo Domingo.

01:05:07.839 --> 01:05:11.119
<v SPEAKER_1>And then I had some Coasties that worked for me when I was in San Antonio.

01:05:11.139 --> 01:05:13.779
<v SPEAKER_1>A lot of respect for the Coasties.

01:05:15.259 --> 01:05:30.759
<v SPEAKER_1>They have a unique mission set that requires for them to adopt almost a Marine Corps type-like approach to leadership.

01:05:32.779 --> 01:05:43.459
<v SPEAKER_1>And one of the things that I heard one of the Lieutenant Commanders say was, if you're the senior man on the boat, you never run.

01:05:44.819 --> 01:05:48.779
<v SPEAKER_1>You never run because it makes the crew nervous.

01:05:49.619 --> 01:05:55.739
<v SPEAKER_1>They see you sprinting, and you're in charge.

01:05:56.499 --> 01:06:06.259
<v SPEAKER_1>In this aspect, they see you becoming emotionally wrapped up in the situation, overreacting, not being steady at the wheel.

01:06:07.659 --> 01:06:27.599
<v SPEAKER_1>It has an impact, and a lot of times, those of us in leadership positions that lose sight of that can generate a certain amount of turmoil and unrest in the unit, and there's nothing to be gained from that.

01:06:29.759 --> 01:06:34.719
<v SPEAKER_2>I agree with you, for danger.

01:06:37.319 --> 01:07:20.219
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know, that being impressionable or whatnot, one of the things I kind of pride myself a little bit on is usually, at least from the view I know, I'm sure the Lance Corporal Underground has a lot of nasty, grim stories, but I think, at least I foresee, most Marines that work for me or have worked for me, that I work with, I think most of them would say that I'm a pretty good person to work for or to work with.

01:07:21.139 --> 01:07:45.299
<v SPEAKER_2>I try to look, so here we go again, my view of thinking and the first line of thinking, which obviously has changed and I guess adapted some, but I've always tried to come into the deal, into the situation that, whether it's the junior Marines or the senior Marines or whatnot, respect's got to be there, it's got to be given.

01:07:45.459 --> 01:07:48.099
<v SPEAKER_1>It's a two-way street?

01:07:51.959 --> 01:07:57.339
<v SPEAKER_2>Yep, no, you're exactly right, but I put my britches on the same way they do every morning.

01:07:57.919 --> 01:07:59.959
<v SPEAKER_2>Tie my boots up.

01:08:00.579 --> 01:08:07.519
<v SPEAKER_2>I've been criticized at times for giving, especially junior Marines, giving them probably more leeway than what a lot of people would have.

01:08:08.999 --> 01:08:16.419
<v SPEAKER_2>But I almost, as a person, we're equal until you prove me otherwise.

01:08:16.639 --> 01:08:17.799
<v SPEAKER_2>You know what I mean?

01:08:18.339 --> 01:08:23.879
<v SPEAKER_2>Again, I've used the analogy of the lot switch sometimes.

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:30.119
<v SPEAKER_2>Personally, it bothers me not one bit for somebody to call me by my first name.

01:08:30.919 --> 01:08:32.199
<v SPEAKER_2>In our ballgame, we don't do that.

01:08:32.559 --> 01:08:33.419
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:36.159
<v SPEAKER_2>So that lot switch has got to be there.

01:08:36.219 --> 01:08:37.499
<v SPEAKER_2>You know what I mean?

01:08:38.039 --> 01:08:41.019
<v SPEAKER_2>But they're just kind of putting us on the level.

01:08:44.879 --> 01:08:45.779
<v SPEAKER_2>Probably giving them...

01:08:47.039 --> 01:08:48.719
<v SPEAKER_2>Joyce gets on to me sometimes.

01:08:48.739 --> 01:08:50.799
<v SPEAKER_2>She says I give them too much slack sometimes.

01:08:52.979 --> 01:08:59.719
<v SPEAKER_2>The guys on the watch for until this past fall, basically I was the top award.

01:08:59.739 --> 01:09:02.959
<v SPEAKER_2>He's the chief there, but I kind of ran the...

01:09:03.099 --> 01:09:04.059
<v SPEAKER_2>You were the hammer.

01:09:04.079 --> 01:09:05.639
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, the hammer, the handler.

01:09:06.539 --> 01:09:08.319
<v SPEAKER_2>I was the handler for all those guys.

01:09:10.119 --> 01:09:14.519
<v SPEAKER_2>I'd probably give them a little bit more leeway than a lot of folks or a lot of guys, a lot of Marines would.

01:09:14.539 --> 01:09:21.139
<v SPEAKER_2>But like I said, that respect piece is a two-way street.

01:09:21.159 --> 01:09:27.259
<v SPEAKER_2>If you expect it, I think you dang sure ought to be holding up your end and giving it as well.

01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:28.439
<v SPEAKER_2>Makes sense.

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:34.599
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, like I said, there's a time when that light switch comes on, and I'll tell them this.

01:09:34.619 --> 01:09:37.499
<v SPEAKER_2>I'll tell them, shit, you've got to know when that is.

01:09:37.519 --> 01:09:38.519
<v SPEAKER_2>You know what I mean?

01:09:38.539 --> 01:09:42.099
<v SPEAKER_2>When it's game time, you know, it's game time.

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:47.599
<v SPEAKER_2>There ain't no room for nonsense.

01:09:48.179 --> 01:09:53.999
<v SPEAKER_2>And I don't get pissed off very often either.

01:09:59.239 --> 01:10:00.919
<v SPEAKER_1>What were some of your favorite duty stations?

01:10:01.999 --> 01:10:03.659
<v SPEAKER_1>Your top two?

01:10:03.919 --> 01:10:04.479
<v SPEAKER_2>Top two?

01:10:14.559 --> 01:10:17.159
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, this is tough.

01:10:17.579 --> 01:10:18.659
<v SPEAKER_2>So Denver, Aurora there at Buckley.

01:10:18.679 --> 01:10:21.259
<v SPEAKER_2>Can we even call that a duty station?

01:10:21.279 --> 01:10:22.139
<v SPEAKER_2>It's like a vacation.

01:10:22.179 --> 01:10:23.119
<v SPEAKER_2>It's an awesome place.

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:25.099
<v SPEAKER_2>Kentucky is my home.

01:10:25.919 --> 01:10:29.139
<v SPEAKER_2>But you could retire in Denver?

01:10:29.159 --> 01:10:31.339
<v SPEAKER_2>Those doggone Rocky Mountains kind of became home.

01:10:31.359 --> 01:10:32.499
<v SPEAKER_1>Joyce is shaking her head, yes.

01:10:35.039 --> 01:10:36.439
<v SPEAKER_1>You could retire in Colorado.

01:10:36.459 --> 01:10:37.019
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, we could.

01:10:37.879 --> 01:10:45.339
<v SPEAKER_2>I really like San Antonio, who doesn't like Texas, but Joyce didn't have a great experience when we moved down there.

01:10:45.359 --> 01:10:48.099
<v SPEAKER_1>There's some people I've come to understand that don't like Texas.

01:10:52.879 --> 01:10:55.299
<v SPEAKER_1>You have to have a big ego to live in Texas.

01:10:55.319 --> 01:10:56.999
<v SPEAKER_1>I would agree with that wholeheartedly.

01:10:58.819 --> 01:10:59.199
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah.

01:10:59.399 --> 01:11:01.219
<v SPEAKER_2>But we had a good time down there.

01:11:02.119 --> 01:11:02.859
<v SPEAKER_2>I really like it.

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:11.399
<v SPEAKER_2>I'd say Joyce didn't have the greatest of experiences and kind of set her mood and set the tone for it.

01:11:11.419 --> 01:11:15.719
<v SPEAKER_1>San Antonio, the crime is bad in San Antonio, and we talked about this a little bit before.

01:11:16.999 --> 01:11:20.219
<v SPEAKER_1>You had some negative experiences with car break-ins and whatnot.

01:11:21.019 --> 01:11:24.599
<v SPEAKER_1>A lot of that is predicated on what part of town you're talking about.

01:11:24.839 --> 01:11:25.139
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:11:25.699 --> 01:11:28.959
<v SPEAKER_1>Elizabeth and I lived on the northeast side in the Stone Oak area.

01:11:29.399 --> 01:11:51.499
<v SPEAKER_1>I essentially did a shape pool and overlaid the great schools' scores for all of the academic institutions in the area with the going rate for rentals, because we weren't looking to buy in San Antonio.

01:11:51.519 --> 01:11:57.219
<v SPEAKER_1>I didn't know how long I was going to be there, and I wanted to kind of play it safe and just rent.

01:11:58.279 --> 01:12:02.259
<v SPEAKER_1>We found a great home in a private gated community right there on the northeast side.

01:12:02.279 --> 01:12:04.239
<v SPEAKER_1>It was really close to a jujitsu gym.

01:12:05.639 --> 01:12:20.559
<v SPEAKER_1>Turns out that that gym closed down, so we ended up finding another one that was even probably a better fit for us with Maha Senki, Sergio Cojea, phenomenal instructor.

01:12:20.719 --> 01:12:31.479
<v SPEAKER_1>So when we could get there, school and work schedules permitted, it was a great spot that the boys and I could continue our training for jujitsu.

01:12:32.039 --> 01:12:39.119
<v SPEAKER_1>Church was like not even a mile away from the house, so we actually got really involved in the church there.

01:12:39.999 --> 01:12:51.679
<v SPEAKER_1>One of the cool things that they did was, maybe in Catholic, right, because I'm Mexican and I don't know any better, they had a, at the Catholic church there, they had a teenage mass for the teenagers.

01:12:51.699 --> 01:13:00.219
<v SPEAKER_1>Teenagers had like reserved VIP seating in the middle and all the families and stuff on the side, and the message was directed at the children.

01:13:00.899 --> 01:13:05.759
<v SPEAKER_1>But that kind of brings me to my next question, is like how religious is the Cross family?

01:13:07.099 --> 01:13:12.679
<v SPEAKER_1>And has that helped you kind of get through your time, if so, in the Marine Corps?

01:13:14.119 --> 01:13:15.539
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I would say yes.

01:13:17.499 --> 01:13:28.479
<v SPEAKER_2>So, I grew up Baptist, like it's not, hey, you want to go to church, it's your mom and dad telling you, get your tail in the car, get up, you're going to church, right?

01:13:28.739 --> 01:13:29.779
<v SPEAKER_1>Sunday best, right?

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:39.319
<v SPEAKER_2>Yep, so I think probably a little bit of rebellion against that a little bit when I came in the Marine Corps.

01:13:41.499 --> 01:13:48.999
<v SPEAKER_2>Kind of steered away from it, veered off the right path for a long time.

01:13:49.019 --> 01:13:55.879
<v SPEAKER_2>When we were second trip to North Carolina, we started going to church a little bit there.

01:13:56.059 --> 01:13:57.679
<v SPEAKER_2>Then we moved to Colorado.

01:13:58.519 --> 01:14:03.299
<v SPEAKER_2>We made some real good friends and got more involved with the church out there.

01:14:05.239 --> 01:14:09.459
<v SPEAKER_2>And by no means were we saints.

01:14:13.639 --> 01:14:23.419
<v SPEAKER_2>But trying to improve on our standing and draw a little bit closer to being on the right road.

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:27.339
<v SPEAKER_2>So you're still Baptist?

01:14:27.359 --> 01:14:28.439
<v SPEAKER_2>I wouldn't say directly.

01:14:28.459 --> 01:14:35.919
<v SPEAKER_2>When we went there, it was actually completely non-denominational out there in Colorado.

01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:39.939
<v SPEAKER_2>And then it was Baptist Church we went to when we were in North Carolina.

01:14:40.419 --> 01:14:41.719
<v SPEAKER_2>We did go to Baptist Church there.

01:14:41.739 --> 01:14:50.559
<v SPEAKER_2>But anyway, when we were out there, it was completely, you know, kind of just didn't have any politics to it, so to speak.

01:14:52.739 --> 01:14:58.359
<v SPEAKER_2>But then when we moved, we came here, we didn't go, like, get back into church.

01:14:58.899 --> 01:15:03.099
<v SPEAKER_2>We didn't find, we started watching videos for a while.

01:15:03.119 --> 01:15:05.479
<v SPEAKER_2>We watched, like, Internet.

01:15:05.859 --> 01:15:09.739
<v SPEAKER_2>From where we were going to church in Colorado, they played it on the Internet.

01:15:11.059 --> 01:15:14.099
<v SPEAKER_2>We just recently, I never really thought about that.

01:15:14.319 --> 01:15:28.979
<v SPEAKER_2>We have not, actually, we have not gone to the church, but we recently got involved with a Bible study group here, here on base on Wednesday nights, with a really good group of people.

01:15:31.259 --> 01:15:36.699
<v SPEAKER_2>And, you know, again, here we go back to one of those main points, the surround yourself with right people.

01:15:36.839 --> 01:15:47.179
<v SPEAKER_2>And I think they, at least in my opinion, I don't know how Joyce feels, but I think it has helped draw us, you know, swing us back to following that compass a little better.

01:15:47.199 --> 01:15:48.059
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

01:15:48.859 --> 01:15:55.879
<v SPEAKER_2>Just, you know, becoming better people, more right with God and along those lines.

01:15:56.199 --> 01:15:58.799
<v SPEAKER_1>Have you guys ever tried any of those MCCS retreats?

01:15:59.659 --> 01:16:00.739
<v SPEAKER_2>No, we actually haven't.

01:16:00.759 --> 01:16:09.439
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know how many times I've read through them, and then I just dump them in file 13 or, you know, or something like that.

01:16:09.459 --> 01:16:14.419
<v SPEAKER_2>But I think I would encourage everybody to probably, you know, check them out.

01:16:14.659 --> 01:16:16.659
<v SPEAKER_2>Matter of fact, I would enjoy checking them out.

01:16:16.679 --> 01:16:18.439
<v SPEAKER_2>We just, it's just always one of those things.

01:16:19.099 --> 01:16:26.919
<v SPEAKER_2>I read them, look at them, like, that's pretty, sounds like a cool idea and a good reasoning and thought behind it.

01:16:27.099 --> 01:16:28.059
<v SPEAKER_2>Just never have done it.

01:16:28.419 --> 01:16:30.519
<v SPEAKER_1>So funny story.

01:16:31.299 --> 01:16:35.459
<v SPEAKER_1>Elizabeth and I got engaged while I was in boot camp.

01:16:37.859 --> 01:16:48.659
<v SPEAKER_1>Senior Jones Sucker gave me the abnormal opportunity to make a phone call when he was taking me to get my anodized brass.

01:16:48.839 --> 01:16:55.859
<v SPEAKER_1>He bought me my anodized brass for my blues, because back then not everybody was issued a blues, but I was the platoon honor man.

01:16:55.879 --> 01:17:06.099
<v SPEAKER_1>So Gunny Crane, for whatever reason, decided his god was going to be wearing anodized brass on our graduation.

01:17:07.019 --> 01:17:14.139
<v SPEAKER_1>And it always stuck with me, but on the way back he asked me, he says, you want to make a phone call?

01:17:15.959 --> 01:17:17.139
<v SPEAKER_1>I'm not going to say no.

01:17:17.159 --> 01:17:29.459
<v SPEAKER_1>And it was at that point in time I called and I spoke with Elizabeth, because it was during the Thanksgiving season, and I proposed to her and asked her to marry me.

01:17:29.859 --> 01:17:33.959
<v SPEAKER_1>She had written me two, three times a day, every day, the whole time I was in boot camp.

01:17:34.719 --> 01:17:44.699
<v SPEAKER_1>And we had been dating for almost a year before me going, but when I enlisted and took off, we kind of left things unspoken.

01:17:45.219 --> 01:17:46.319
<v SPEAKER_1>Like we didn't know.

01:17:47.459 --> 01:17:59.659
<v SPEAKER_1>And to be honest, I was more fixated on my career in the Marine Corps, knowing that I wanted to do 20 as a recruit.

01:17:59.699 --> 01:18:08.559
<v SPEAKER_1>I was saying this, and of course, the first sergeant in the drill was like, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about, but here we are almost 19 years later.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:14.019
<v SPEAKER_1>I was right.

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:16.579
<v SPEAKER_1>I knew it was going to be for me.

01:18:18.719 --> 01:18:21.499
<v SPEAKER_1>So we got married right after I graduated from boot camp.

01:18:21.939 --> 01:18:22.499
<v SPEAKER_1>She was there.

01:18:22.519 --> 01:18:24.199
<v SPEAKER_1>She flew in for my graduation.

01:18:25.139 --> 01:18:28.159
<v SPEAKER_1>A little civil ceremony.

01:18:28.179 --> 01:18:33.419
<v SPEAKER_1>A family friend who was a county judge married us.

01:18:35.999 --> 01:18:49.639
<v SPEAKER_1>But later, when we got to DLI, she followed me after MCT, and I checked in DLI, and I was there for a good while before she actually caught up with me until the end of her school year.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:52.919
<v SPEAKER_1>We were planning a year later to get married to the church.

01:18:52.939 --> 01:18:55.179
<v SPEAKER_1>That was the agreement that I had with my father-in-law.

01:18:55.519 --> 01:18:58.619
<v SPEAKER_1>You can get married in a civil ceremony, but you got to get married through the church.

01:18:59.719 --> 01:19:04.999
<v SPEAKER_1>Like I said, see previous statement about us being Mexicans and not knowing any better about the Catholic Church.

01:19:07.039 --> 01:19:13.399
<v SPEAKER_1>And I say that in jest because I'm still Catholic, but at the time, I wasn't confirmed.

01:19:14.739 --> 01:19:19.619
<v SPEAKER_1>And I didn't get confirmed until years later, but that's another story.

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:27.819
<v SPEAKER_1>But part of the requirements for the Catholic Church and for the Marine Corps detachment was we had to go through this marriage retreat.

01:19:28.839 --> 01:19:39.119
<v SPEAKER_1>And so we go in, and it's at San Luis Obispo, right outside of Monterey, California, and they make us sleep in separate rooms.

01:19:40.039 --> 01:19:41.059
<v SPEAKER_1>But we're already married.

01:19:41.419 --> 01:19:47.599
<v SPEAKER_1>I got a house in base housing, 163 Okinawa Road, of all things.

01:19:50.479 --> 01:19:55.659
<v SPEAKER_1>Which I didn't really put two and two together until just now, because we were stationed in Okinawa.

01:19:58.659 --> 01:20:02.419
<v SPEAKER_1>So we're in separate rooms, and we're going through this marriage retreat.

01:20:02.779 --> 01:20:16.139
<v SPEAKER_1>There's breakout sessions where you're talking with just the men, you're just talking with your significant other, your wife or your fiancé, and then certain sessions where all the couples are together.

01:20:17.059 --> 01:20:30.539
<v SPEAKER_1>And I will say that it was a fundamental experience that Elizabeth and I had, and I learned things about her during that process that I probably wouldn't have otherwise.

01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:43.839
<v SPEAKER_1>And it kind of pulls you out of your normal routine and forces you to kind of examine the nature of your relationship.

01:20:43.959 --> 01:20:46.599
<v SPEAKER_1>And I know you got a good woman.

01:20:46.639 --> 01:20:47.499
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, it's apparent.

01:20:47.519 --> 01:20:51.399
<v SPEAKER_1>I walked into this house, and like I told you earlier, it feels like a home.

01:20:53.559 --> 01:20:57.459
<v SPEAKER_1>And I know for a fact you wouldn't be where you're at, were it not for her.

01:20:58.299 --> 01:21:02.779
<v SPEAKER_1>But just like anything else, there's always room for improvement.

01:21:03.699 --> 01:21:23.299
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, for what it's worth, I'd recommend taking a look at those retreats, and definitely would recommend encouraging your junior Marines to take advantage of them too, because although they might not be for everybody, I think that there's a lot of good to be had by those experiences.

01:21:25.379 --> 01:21:35.299
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I think the same has been said, you know, we were talking about being involved with church and religion or whatnot.

01:21:35.879 --> 01:21:41.599
<v SPEAKER_2>I think all the time that brings us into learning something new about each other.

01:21:41.619 --> 01:21:42.979
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know how she feels about it.

01:21:44.359 --> 01:21:50.459
<v SPEAKER_2>Just the conversations that those things bring up, you know what I mean?

01:21:50.799 --> 01:22:06.839
<v SPEAKER_2>I think they all the time share thoughts and ideas that we have as individuals that we oftentimes don't think about together or in normal conversation or whatnot.

01:22:07.379 --> 01:22:13.839
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, no, I think they're great, they're probably, they'll definitely be a really neat thing.

01:22:14.159 --> 01:22:19.039
<v SPEAKER_2>Maybe next time I get the email, I won't slide it over to the delete box.

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:20.239
<v SPEAKER_1>Just delete it immediately.

01:22:20.259 --> 01:22:35.699
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I have absolutely nothing against the talk, you know, talk of marriage, oftentimes, you know, of course, you know, you kind of know our story, but I was one of those guys.

01:22:36.239 --> 01:22:37.079
<v SPEAKER_2>I was that corporal.

01:22:37.679 --> 01:22:41.539
<v SPEAKER_2>They are probably, in a lot of them's eyes, that's the last corporal decision.

01:22:42.079 --> 01:22:46.719
<v SPEAKER_2>But good old Gunny Master aren't retired now, a wine job.

01:22:47.159 --> 01:22:49.759
<v SPEAKER_2>I'll never forget to look on his face.

01:22:49.779 --> 01:22:51.719
<v SPEAKER_2>He's like, what the hell did you do?

01:22:52.319 --> 01:22:53.699
<v SPEAKER_2>We were like, how many days out?

01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:54.139
<v SPEAKER_2>Nine days?

01:22:54.519 --> 01:22:55.879
<v SPEAKER_2>Nine days out from deployment.

01:22:56.059 --> 01:22:57.819
<v SPEAKER_2>We had been on the pre-deployment leave.

01:22:58.719 --> 01:23:05.719
<v SPEAKER_2>We were already engaged, but our intention was to wait till we got back.

01:23:06.099 --> 01:23:08.859
<v SPEAKER_2>We were going on the Mew.

01:23:08.879 --> 01:23:10.139
<v SPEAKER_2>We knew we were going to Iraq.

01:23:10.739 --> 01:23:14.959
<v SPEAKER_2>That was the game plan anyway on that first trip out.

01:23:16.819 --> 01:23:17.539
<v SPEAKER_1>This was what year?

01:23:18.219 --> 01:23:20.299
<v SPEAKER_2>This was in 2005.

01:23:23.539 --> 01:23:25.339
<v SPEAKER_2>But our intent was to wait till we got back.

01:23:25.359 --> 01:23:29.679
<v SPEAKER_2>We were going to, like you said, get married with church, or with a preacher.

01:23:31.839 --> 01:23:39.479
<v SPEAKER_2>I shouldn't say church, but we were going to get married more of the religious route, traditional route.

01:23:40.419 --> 01:23:44.539
<v SPEAKER_2>One night laying in bed, I don't know if I had an epiphany.

01:23:45.759 --> 01:23:47.359
<v SPEAKER_2>Call it what you will.

01:23:47.779 --> 01:23:52.239
<v SPEAKER_2>But I was like, this is a dumb idea.

01:23:53.339 --> 01:23:59.799
<v SPEAKER_2>If I'm already, in my heart, trust her, that I'm going to marry her when I get back, we're engaged now.

01:23:59.819 --> 01:24:04.939
<v SPEAKER_2>I was like, I'm going to be a little bit honest, a little bit brutal honest here.

01:24:05.239 --> 01:24:13.839
<v SPEAKER_2>But I said, why would I wait when I'm about to have six months worth of pay that could set us up for our future?

01:24:15.419 --> 01:24:16.459
<v SPEAKER_2>That sounds bad, right?

01:24:16.679 --> 01:24:17.799
<v SPEAKER_2>That sounds bad.

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.819
<v SPEAKER_2>So I can see why he said, what the hell did you do?

01:24:20.779 --> 01:24:22.399
<v SPEAKER_2>I can definitely see where it came from.

01:24:22.799 --> 01:24:25.659
<v SPEAKER_2>But the truth comes out.

01:24:25.979 --> 01:24:27.579
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, no kidding, I should tell you.

01:24:27.679 --> 01:24:31.419
<v SPEAKER_2>So the next morning, I got up and blasted her.

01:24:31.439 --> 01:24:35.039
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, it was like probably like pie in the face.

01:24:35.079 --> 01:24:38.139
<v SPEAKER_2>When I said that to her, I was like, let's go to the courthouse and get married.

01:24:39.139 --> 01:24:41.259
<v SPEAKER_2>And sure enough, that's what we did.

01:24:41.599 --> 01:24:42.319
<v SPEAKER_2>We were too nervous.

01:24:42.339 --> 01:24:43.519
<v SPEAKER_2>I was even too nervous to call her.

01:24:43.539 --> 01:24:45.079
<v SPEAKER_2>We lived in her brother's house with her brother.

01:24:45.339 --> 01:24:47.199
<v SPEAKER_2>Who was your best man?

01:24:47.959 --> 01:24:52.519
<v SPEAKER_2>Chris McCarthy, a friend of mine that was there.

01:24:52.539 --> 01:24:53.639
<v SPEAKER_2>He was a Marine at that time.

01:24:53.659 --> 01:24:54.259
<v SPEAKER_2>He's out now.

01:24:55.419 --> 01:24:57.259
<v SPEAKER_2>Chris McCarthy.

01:24:58.619 --> 01:25:01.199
<v SPEAKER_2>I was afraid to ask her brother to be a witness.

01:25:01.439 --> 01:25:03.059
<v SPEAKER_3>I think he was home yet.

01:25:03.479 --> 01:25:04.119
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, he was home.

01:25:04.759 --> 01:25:05.559
<v SPEAKER_2>He was absolutely home.

01:25:05.579 --> 01:25:09.419
<v SPEAKER_2>Because he said that day, he was like, if you had just told me, if you had just asked me, he would have said how he came down there.

01:25:09.839 --> 01:25:13.399
<v SPEAKER_2>But, you know, corporal, he was the gunny then.

01:25:13.419 --> 01:25:16.459
<v SPEAKER_2>He was the gunny.

01:25:16.579 --> 01:25:18.939
<v SPEAKER_1>You come down here and witness me marry my sister?

01:25:19.159 --> 01:25:21.479
<v SPEAKER_2>So I was too nervous to do that.

01:25:21.839 --> 01:25:23.979
<v SPEAKER_1>But you had already asked the family, right?

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:25.419
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I asked her dad.

01:25:26.639 --> 01:25:27.719
<v SPEAKER_2>That's a funny story, too.

01:25:28.119 --> 01:25:29.479
<v SPEAKER_1>Please, please share.

01:25:30.339 --> 01:25:31.199
<v SPEAKER_2>We got out of work.

01:25:32.379 --> 01:25:40.219
<v SPEAKER_2>We had actually, we had been, I think we had been in the field, you know, the East Coast Mew Workups, how that plays out.

01:25:40.239 --> 01:25:41.839
<v SPEAKER_2>In the field, out of the field, in the field, out.

01:25:42.439 --> 01:25:43.519
<v SPEAKER_2>Me and Matt Grossell.

01:25:47.459 --> 01:25:49.999
<v SPEAKER_2>Me and Matt, what's that dude's name?

01:25:52.999 --> 01:25:53.959
<v SPEAKER_2>I can see his face.

01:25:54.639 --> 01:25:55.259
<v SPEAKER_2>McCracken.

01:25:56.219 --> 01:25:56.679
<v SPEAKER_2>McCracken.

01:25:56.699 --> 01:25:57.539
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I know McCracken.

01:25:57.559 --> 01:25:59.919
<v SPEAKER_2>We called him Big Erm, but that wasn't his name.

01:25:59.919 --> 01:26:00.559
<v SPEAKER_1>Big Erm.

01:26:00.839 --> 01:26:11.319
<v SPEAKER_2>But McCracken, we were standing on the catwalk of the 2nd Radio Battalion Barracks, and we were eating, of all things, these little Tostinos microwave pizza things.

01:26:11.819 --> 01:26:16.319
<v SPEAKER_2>And I told him, I was like, here's what I'm about to do, boys.

01:26:16.539 --> 01:26:18.199
<v SPEAKER_2>And I was nervous.

01:26:18.479 --> 01:26:19.259
<v SPEAKER_2>I didn't know what to do.

01:26:19.779 --> 01:26:21.059
<v SPEAKER_2>So we kicked a few...

01:26:21.079 --> 01:26:22.119
<v SPEAKER_1>What were you nervous about?

01:26:22.799 --> 01:26:23.599
<v SPEAKER_2>Talking to her dad.

01:26:23.819 --> 01:26:25.119
<v SPEAKER_2>I'd never met him.

01:26:25.539 --> 01:26:26.319
<v SPEAKER_2>I had never met her family.

01:26:26.339 --> 01:26:27.139
<v SPEAKER_1>You had never met him?

01:26:27.159 --> 01:26:27.659
<v SPEAKER_2>Her brothers.

01:26:27.679 --> 01:26:29.739
<v SPEAKER_1>How long had y'all been dating and you had not met her family?

01:26:30.119 --> 01:26:30.819
<v SPEAKER_2>Not too long.

01:26:31.079 --> 01:26:31.559
<v SPEAKER_2>We didn't.

01:26:33.999 --> 01:26:38.539
<v SPEAKER_2>But we really, I guess, got together, I would say, in the springtime.

01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:46.979
<v SPEAKER_2>And then the 4th of July was when things really, I guess, kind of got more serious or whatnot.

01:26:47.679 --> 01:26:55.239
<v SPEAKER_2>And this would have been in September time frame when I called her dad.

01:26:55.779 --> 01:26:57.839
<v SPEAKER_2>And I don't even remember how I got his phone number.

01:26:57.859 --> 01:26:58.659
<v SPEAKER_2>I don't know if I asked.

01:26:58.679 --> 01:27:00.499
<v SPEAKER_2>You got it out of her phone.

01:27:04.119 --> 01:27:05.439
<v SPEAKER_1>We got a fat checker right here.

01:27:05.459 --> 01:27:06.859
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, I was super nervous.

01:27:06.979 --> 01:27:10.779
<v SPEAKER_2>So I was like, I think I might need another one of those Bud Lights.

01:27:11.219 --> 01:27:14.239
<v SPEAKER_2>But anyways, I called her dad and I asked if he knows.

01:27:16.179 --> 01:27:18.919
<v SPEAKER_2>I told him who I was, introduced myself, and I said, yeah.

01:27:18.939 --> 01:27:24.659
<v SPEAKER_2>I said, I was wondering what you think about me asking Joyce to marry me.

01:27:25.179 --> 01:27:30.919
<v SPEAKER_2>And he said, well, I guess that would be up to her.

01:27:31.019 --> 01:27:33.819
<v SPEAKER_2>Basically, it went way better.

01:27:33.879 --> 01:27:35.259
<v SPEAKER_2>Her mom answered the phone first.

01:27:35.519 --> 01:27:46.099
<v SPEAKER_2>I guess the conversation really went way better than what I had initially worked it up to in your head.

01:27:46.119 --> 01:27:48.799
<v SPEAKER_2>He basically said that it was her decision.

01:27:53.039 --> 01:28:10.139
<v SPEAKER_2>We went home, which was another kind of story in itself, because, like I said, growing up in a Baptist family, I had never really brought girlfriends home too much.

01:28:12.719 --> 01:28:19.419
<v SPEAKER_2>So I told my mom, I said, I'm coming home for pre-appointment leave, and I was like, I'm going to have a plus one coming with me.

01:28:20.079 --> 01:28:24.979
<v SPEAKER_2>Then I told her it was a girl, and I honestly wasn't too worried about it.

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:32.759
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, at that time, well, I'm sure I was worried about it, but had mom said, no, you're not staying here, I would have stayed with my grandma.

01:28:32.779 --> 01:28:33.299
<v SPEAKER_2>You know what I mean?

01:28:33.319 --> 01:28:34.119
<v SPEAKER_2>We would have still went home.

01:28:34.399 --> 01:28:34.699
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

01:28:34.879 --> 01:28:36.499
<v SPEAKER_2>And I would have still took her with me.

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:49.499
<v SPEAKER_2>But anyways, we get home, and I don't know, I don't know how many days we were there, but kind of a funny situation, we went and had family portraits made that day.

01:28:49.959 --> 01:28:54.679
<v SPEAKER_2>That very night, I asked her, we got a pond that's in our yard.

01:28:54.699 --> 01:29:01.799
<v SPEAKER_2>It used to be a cow pasture pond that had some really good fishing, so me and dad decided we were going to make it part of our yard.

01:29:02.359 --> 01:29:07.239
<v SPEAKER_2>And we had a little dock there, and we went down there to the pond, and that's where I asked her.

01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:11.859
<v SPEAKER_2>But anyways, I don't know what time, 10 o'clock at night or something, we had been somewhere, we came home.

01:29:12.499 --> 01:29:18.939
<v SPEAKER_2>But long story short, it was really, my mom felt a little awkward the next day because we didn't tell anybody.

01:29:19.299 --> 01:29:21.299
<v SPEAKER_2>None of them knew I was going about to do this.

01:29:21.819 --> 01:29:24.339
<v SPEAKER_2>We didn't say anything the next morning, and we went to church with them.

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:30.299
<v SPEAKER_2>And we were sitting in church, and mom saw that ring on her finger.

01:29:31.479 --> 01:29:37.979
<v SPEAKER_2>And she said she knew it then, but I told them after that, you know, after church.

01:29:38.359 --> 01:29:45.019
<v SPEAKER_2>But just kind of funny thing, mom said, she said, well, she said, if we didn't do that, she said, we just got our family portraits made.

01:29:45.219 --> 01:29:47.079
<v SPEAKER_2>She would have been, you know, we would have included her in them.

01:29:47.439 --> 01:29:51.339
<v SPEAKER_1>She also took the family portraits, but Joyce just kind of stood on the side and watched.

01:29:51.799 --> 01:29:52.899
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29:53.599 --> 01:29:57.019
<v SPEAKER_2>But if I was your mom, I would have pissed at you too.

01:29:57.239 --> 01:29:58.459
<v SPEAKER_1>Wasted an opportunity.

01:29:58.479 --> 01:30:01.699
<v SPEAKER_1>You got a new daughter-in-law, a new addition to the family.

01:30:02.259 --> 01:30:04.499
<v SPEAKER_2>But I didn't get along with mom now.

01:30:06.079 --> 01:30:07.419
<v SPEAKER_3>I get along with her good now.

01:30:10.099 --> 01:30:11.619
<v SPEAKER_2>But now, it took a while.

01:30:14.099 --> 01:30:14.659
<v SPEAKER_1>That's awesome.

01:30:14.919 --> 01:30:17.079
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, it took a while.

01:30:17.359 --> 01:30:18.559
<v SPEAKER_1>So funny story.

01:30:18.679 --> 01:30:23.519
<v SPEAKER_1>Elizabeth and my mom hung out before I even met Liz.

01:30:24.119 --> 01:30:24.959
<v SPEAKER_1>They were friends.

01:30:26.059 --> 01:30:31.039
<v SPEAKER_1>You have to remember that Liz is older than me by about three years.

01:30:33.359 --> 01:30:36.639
<v SPEAKER_1>And my mom had me when she was about 15.

01:30:37.939 --> 01:30:42.219
<v SPEAKER_1>So there's not that much of an age difference between my mom and my wife.

01:30:43.319 --> 01:30:47.819
<v SPEAKER_1>So they hung out before I even met Liz.

01:30:48.639 --> 01:30:56.479
<v SPEAKER_1>And so when my mom found out that I was actually dating her, my mom said, that woman has her shit together.

01:30:56.779 --> 01:30:58.879
<v SPEAKER_1>She's got a master's degree in education.

01:30:58.899 --> 01:30:59.619
<v SPEAKER_1>She's a teacher.

01:30:59.639 --> 01:31:00.399
<v SPEAKER_1>She's got a career.

01:31:00.419 --> 01:31:01.459
<v SPEAKER_1>She's going places.

01:31:01.459 --> 01:31:02.799
<v SPEAKER_1>What is she seeing you?

01:31:07.919 --> 01:31:14.379
<v SPEAKER_2>It's funny how those relationships play out, you know what I mean?

01:31:14.399 --> 01:31:15.179
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:31:15.199 --> 01:31:21.439
<v SPEAKER_1>I mean, they've had their ups and downs, my mom and my wife, but now they talk more than I talk to my mom.

01:31:21.639 --> 01:31:21.939
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:31:22.379 --> 01:31:23.699
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:31:24.299 --> 01:31:28.659
<v SPEAKER_2>So that went on back to me waking up that morning so I would get married.

01:31:28.679 --> 01:31:30.799
<v SPEAKER_2>We went to the courthouse, got married, and still didn't tell anybody.

01:31:32.059 --> 01:31:36.179
<v SPEAKER_2>Other than, I think we told the brother that night or a little bit later.

01:31:36.699 --> 01:31:37.719
<v SPEAKER_2>Anyway, we told him a little later.

01:31:38.319 --> 01:31:44.139
<v SPEAKER_2>But my mom and my sister came down right before we went on, right before we left for deployment.

01:31:44.619 --> 01:31:47.539
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, my aunt, yeah, came down.

01:31:47.879 --> 01:31:49.899
<v SPEAKER_2>And Joyce had to work that day, and we had to go out to eat.

01:31:50.279 --> 01:31:52.919
<v SPEAKER_2>And all they're talking about is this wedding we're about to have when we get back.

01:31:53.339 --> 01:31:57.359
<v SPEAKER_2>And I said, well, I said, what would you say if we were already married?

01:31:57.879 --> 01:32:01.579
<v SPEAKER_2>And so that kind of came out, you know, and they knew that.

01:32:01.599 --> 01:32:04.579
<v SPEAKER_2>But then when we came back from deployment, I mean, it played out again.

01:32:05.719 --> 01:32:06.979
<v SPEAKER_2>I wouldn't do it any other way now.

01:32:07.599 --> 01:32:09.319
<v SPEAKER_2>It played out good because we came back.

01:32:09.339 --> 01:32:10.179
<v SPEAKER_2>We had a ceremony.

01:32:10.919 --> 01:32:15.919
<v SPEAKER_2>Her uncle, he was a preacher, you know, married us.

01:32:16.479 --> 01:32:20.919
<v SPEAKER_2>We had the families come by, cooked a big pig, had it, you know, we had a good time with it.

01:32:22.459 --> 01:32:33.899
<v SPEAKER_2>But I will say that if it weren't for her, you know, we know how the game, how it traditionally plays, what the percentages are.

01:32:33.919 --> 01:32:34.059
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

01:32:34.179 --> 01:32:36.999
<v SPEAKER_2>Especially when they get married in that type of scenario.

01:32:38.599 --> 01:32:44.119
<v SPEAKER_2>But, yeah, I'll lay it, I'll lay nearly all of it to her.

01:32:44.139 --> 01:32:52.499
<v SPEAKER_2>If it wasn't for the person she is, we would probably have, you know, we could have easily have been one of those percentage people.

01:32:52.979 --> 01:32:53.219
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

01:32:53.239 --> 01:32:57.519
<v SPEAKER_2>I mean, we've been married, we just, this past October was 12 years.

01:32:58.479 --> 01:33:03.019
<v SPEAKER_2>We've been married 12 years and got no intents to change anything.

01:33:05.299 --> 01:33:06.539
<v SPEAKER_2>Got a lifetime ahead of us.

01:33:08.579 --> 01:33:12.559
<v SPEAKER_1>So if I'm getting too personal, you can just tell me to shut the hell up.

01:33:12.579 --> 01:33:14.899
<v SPEAKER_1>But why have you not had kids?

01:33:15.459 --> 01:33:18.219
<v SPEAKER_1>Is that a personal decision or is it?

01:33:18.979 --> 01:33:24.119
<v SPEAKER_2>No, we, so I'll tell you, we haven't done nothing to stop it.

01:33:24.679 --> 01:33:32.759
<v SPEAKER_2>We've more recently found out some potential, maybe some health issues is what's causing it, right?

01:33:33.679 --> 01:33:41.459
<v SPEAKER_2>And we've had a couple doctors trips, but that obviously hasn't worked.

01:33:41.919 --> 01:33:47.959
<v SPEAKER_2>So we've actually been talking, it's about time to go back again to try and take the next step.

01:33:47.979 --> 01:33:50.919
<v SPEAKER_1>I talked to fertility specialists?

01:33:50.939 --> 01:33:55.719
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, it's definitely something we would like to have.

01:33:55.739 --> 01:34:03.279
<v SPEAKER_1>For me, that's the only thing I see missing, just some little rugrats running around, screaming and yelling with a cowboy hat and a sick shooter cap gun.

01:34:03.739 --> 01:34:13.459
<v SPEAKER_2>I told her for a long time, before we found out that was the reason behind it, I told her, I was like, I don't know, I'm still a kid myself, look at the table right here again.

01:34:13.479 --> 01:34:17.519
<v SPEAKER_1>I don't know whose remote control helicopter that is, but I don't think it's Joyce's.

01:34:23.459 --> 01:34:29.679
<v SPEAKER_2>But then when we found out, it kind of saddens things up a little bit, you find out there's a legitimate issue behind it.

01:34:29.699 --> 01:34:39.519
<v SPEAKER_2>But we worked through it, and we've talked, if it takes it, one of these days we'll even look at adoption.

01:34:39.779 --> 01:34:48.379
<v SPEAKER_1>Listen, I've talked about that from time to time, and I think two is enough for us.

01:34:48.399 --> 01:34:50.319
<v SPEAKER_1>I kind of hung up my gloves.

01:34:52.039 --> 01:34:56.439
<v SPEAKER_1>And from a family planning standpoint, I just think that it's a solid fit where we're at.

01:34:56.459 --> 01:35:00.199
<v SPEAKER_1>I've got a 16-year-old and an 11-year-old, two boys, I'm done.

01:35:00.219 --> 01:35:02.879
<v SPEAKER_1>I hung up my gloves.

01:35:03.499 --> 01:35:07.259
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, I'm content where we're at.

01:35:07.279 --> 01:35:16.219
<v SPEAKER_1>But sometimes, occasionally, we've talked in the past about a little girl, a little girl, a little girl.

01:35:16.239 --> 01:35:17.819
<v SPEAKER_1>And I was telling Sonny this the other night.

01:35:17.839 --> 01:35:21.999
<v SPEAKER_1>A little girl would have me wrapped around her finger.

01:35:22.159 --> 01:35:27.119
<v SPEAKER_1>Like I told him, there's a young gunny that lives right next to us in the towers there in Okee.

01:35:28.159 --> 01:35:33.639
<v SPEAKER_1>And he's got three beautiful little girls and the most precious things on this earth.

01:35:33.719 --> 01:35:38.619
<v SPEAKER_1>When they ever interact with me, Mr.

01:35:38.839 --> 01:35:43.279
<v SPEAKER_1>Sam, and one of them the youngest, I can't even understand what she says because of the way her voice is.

01:35:43.299 --> 01:35:45.719
<v SPEAKER_1>But whenever they ask me for anything, I'm all in.

01:35:45.739 --> 01:35:46.739
<v SPEAKER_1>Like, what do you want?

01:35:46.759 --> 01:35:47.279
<v SPEAKER_1>What do you want?

01:35:47.299 --> 01:35:49.579
<v SPEAKER_1>You know, what do you got?

01:35:50.019 --> 01:35:53.439
<v SPEAKER_1>But my boys, I can be hard on them.

01:35:53.579 --> 01:35:55.619
<v SPEAKER_1>And firm and fair.

01:35:55.639 --> 01:35:57.279
<v SPEAKER_1>You know, we play and we hang out.

01:35:57.299 --> 01:35:57.959
<v SPEAKER_1>We do our thing.

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:02.639
<v SPEAKER_2>But girls, yeah.

01:36:02.659 --> 01:36:04.199
<v SPEAKER_2>That's what Joyce all the time tells me.

01:36:04.219 --> 01:36:07.919
<v SPEAKER_2>So, we've got a pastoral of nieces and nephews.

01:36:11.859 --> 01:36:16.279
<v SPEAKER_1>Yeah, we got a sackful.

01:36:16.299 --> 01:36:18.199
<v SPEAKER_1>That's not a common word, a pastoral.

01:36:18.379 --> 01:36:19.879
<v SPEAKER_2>A bunch, I'll put it out.

01:36:19.899 --> 01:36:20.639
<v SPEAKER_2>We got several.

01:36:20.859 --> 01:36:28.099
<v SPEAKER_2>But, so we've been able to live, you know, some of that, you know, through them.

01:36:28.559 --> 01:36:30.019
<v SPEAKER_2>But she's all the time giving me a hard time.

01:36:30.859 --> 01:36:39.279
<v SPEAKER_2>She's like, she's like, when I had kids, she's like, it would be twice as hard on her because I would, she said, I'd be just as bad as they were, you know what I mean?

01:36:39.299 --> 01:36:41.379
<v SPEAKER_2>Like agging them on and everything else.

01:36:41.379 --> 01:36:52.559
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, it's been super fortunate, you know, when we're close by, we have them over, spend the night, stay with us all the time, spend as much time as we can with them.

01:36:53.379 --> 01:36:56.059
<v SPEAKER_2>But yeah, she's all the time telling them I'd have them too spoke.

01:36:56.459 --> 01:37:01.339
<v SPEAKER_2>But she's just as guilty of having them, just to spoil, ask their mom and daddy.

01:37:02.439 --> 01:37:07.539
<v SPEAKER_3>It's pretty bad when she was three, four at the time.

01:37:10.499 --> 01:37:13.359
<v SPEAKER_3>My brother, he has three boys and a little girl, and she's the baby.

01:37:14.179 --> 01:37:22.939
<v SPEAKER_3>And the boys were in school, so I was watching her, he was deployed, and the mom's a teacher, and he was deployed and I went down there.

01:37:22.959 --> 01:37:27.019
<v SPEAKER_3>I was kinda helping her out while he was gone, and her mom went back to New York.

01:37:28.179 --> 01:37:35.359
<v SPEAKER_3>And we'd go to town, we'd stop at Walmart, and she'd find her a toy that she'd want, and I'd say, okay, you can get it.

01:37:36.399 --> 01:37:42.399
<v SPEAKER_3>Then her mom took her to Toys R Us, and she was wanting a bathing suit, and her mom told her, no, she wasn't getting it.

01:37:42.419 --> 01:37:46.939
<v SPEAKER_3>She said, well, if Aunt Joyce was here, I'd get it.

01:37:46.959 --> 01:37:48.979
<v SPEAKER_1>She already figured out the cheat code.

01:37:50.839 --> 01:37:56.659
<v SPEAKER_2>But I will say, getting married, step one, the point is tough.

01:38:00.379 --> 01:38:05.259
<v SPEAKER_2>And being married, if you're married for the right reason, it makes it that much tougher being gone.

01:38:06.719 --> 01:38:14.279
<v SPEAKER_2>But sometimes, I give it to you guys that do have children, because that's even another step tougher.

01:38:15.979 --> 01:38:31.639
<v SPEAKER_2>But I've thought about that a bunch, when we get down rain somewhere, and I'm like, that's bad enough, I'm missing her, but this guy next to me, not only is he missing his wife, but he's got two babies too.

01:38:31.659 --> 01:38:37.479
<v SPEAKER_1>So good, bad, or indifferent, the last major deployment that I had was coming off of that mule in 2008.

01:38:37.799 --> 01:38:48.299
<v SPEAKER_1>And Liz took a picture of the boys, and they were hanging outside the skiff there at 2nd Radio Battalion, laying in the grass, looking up at the stars, waiting for daddy to come home.

01:38:49.179 --> 01:39:09.379
<v SPEAKER_1>And when I saw them little munchkins, and they were wearing custom designed t-shirts, talking about my daddy's a Marine and this and that and whatnot, I just hugged those boys, and I couldn't hug them any tighter, and it's tough.

01:39:09.939 --> 01:39:10.659
<v SPEAKER_1>It is tough.

01:39:11.959 --> 01:39:40.339
<v SPEAKER_1>But I will say that it's given them an appreciation and an understanding of what it is that we do, being the type of men that will grab a radio and a rifle and go forward, without any clear understanding of what we're going to be up against, and appreciating the fact that we may not come home.

01:39:41.759 --> 01:39:51.479
<v SPEAKER_1>But, you know, I mean, for me, it's not about anything other than the Marines to the left and right of me.

01:39:53.579 --> 01:39:58.459
<v SPEAKER_1>And that brotherhood and that camaraderie really makes it worth it.

01:39:59.519 --> 01:40:01.879
<v SPEAKER_1>And I hope that one day my boys will understand it.

01:40:05.999 --> 01:40:12.299
<v SPEAKER_1>They've had to make sacrifices due to the PCSs and those transitions that come into play.

01:40:12.319 --> 01:40:31.999
<v SPEAKER_1>But I think that's a lot of the reason why I wanted to sit down with my peers and press record and go over those lessons learned and some of those dynamics that go into making a life out of this, as opposed to just one and done.

01:40:32.639 --> 01:40:42.759
<v SPEAKER_1>Because in the aggregate, it changes over time, your experience from when you're a Lance Corporal to when you're a Master Sergeant.

01:40:42.859 --> 01:40:49.039
<v SPEAKER_1>And you learn things in the process, and you meet people along your journey.

01:40:50.319 --> 01:40:57.699
<v SPEAKER_1>And I think there's a lot to be gained by this type of interaction.

01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:06.099
<v SPEAKER_1>And you kind of listened to the podcast that I did with Gunny Sonovan.

01:41:06.459 --> 01:41:09.119
<v SPEAKER_1>What did you think about it when I first brought it up to you?

01:41:11.219 --> 01:41:20.239
<v SPEAKER_2>So when you first mentioned it the other night, I was like, yeah, it sounds like a neat idea, but I honestly didn't give it too much thought or whatnot.

01:41:20.259 --> 01:41:26.519
<v SPEAKER_2>And then last night when you sent me the copy of that one over, I was listening to it, me and Joyce were sitting here talking about it.

01:41:26.539 --> 01:41:29.939
<v SPEAKER_2>And I said, you know, that's pretty cool.

01:41:29.959 --> 01:41:48.359
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, it's a neat idea, and I think it has value, like you just said, you know, like, kind of like what you were talking, because yeah, you know, me and you, we know most, obviously we're going to know or be familiar with most of the people, at least the folks you have on the list at the moment.

01:41:48.379 --> 01:42:11.079
<v SPEAKER_2>But they, you know, what you said earlier, and you said it in the podcast with Sonny, talking about if some, me and you having this conversation, it's not a conversation that the average Joe at work, whether he be a Lance Corporal or whoever, or even a Lieutenant, is going to hear us half.

01:42:11.499 --> 01:42:20.199
<v SPEAKER_2>The conversation is going to be totally different, but I think there's value in that, you know what I mean?

01:42:22.019 --> 01:42:24.079
<v SPEAKER_2>I would have listened to it, you know what I mean, back then.

01:42:24.099 --> 01:42:28.799
<v SPEAKER_2>Especially if you listen to one, I think you're going to get drawn in and hooked.

01:42:28.819 --> 01:42:42.799
<v SPEAKER_2>One who knows where it's going to go, but you know, talking about some life lessons, some professional lessons that we've learned, experiences we've had, really took us.

01:42:42.819 --> 01:42:48.899
<v SPEAKER_2>Talking about the sacrifices piece, you know, it's going to be a tough road.

01:42:48.919 --> 01:42:54.999
<v SPEAKER_2>And the farther you go, the longer you hang in the game, the tougher it's going to get.

01:42:55.359 --> 01:43:00.979
<v SPEAKER_2>We still have moderate arguments about, you know, it's 6.30 at night, why are you not home?

01:43:00.999 --> 01:43:01.439
<v SPEAKER_2>You know what I mean?

01:43:01.819 --> 01:43:07.919
<v SPEAKER_2>Back in the day, I mean, 4.30 came, and Gunny or Staff Sergeant says, all right, you guys are cut up tomorrow, we're gone.

01:43:07.939 --> 01:43:09.339
<v SPEAKER_2>We fly like birds.

01:43:09.579 --> 01:43:11.239
<v SPEAKER_2>It don't work that way now.

01:43:11.719 --> 01:43:18.059
<v SPEAKER_2>You got to take care of, not only you take care of your family at home, but you've got a family there and an obligation to those Marines.

01:43:18.939 --> 01:43:24.579
<v SPEAKER_2>You got to make sure they're ready, whether you're there from daylight till dark or till way after dark.

01:43:24.599 --> 01:43:30.119
<v SPEAKER_1>You really see the Marines that you work for as your family?

01:43:30.559 --> 01:43:31.319
<v SPEAKER_2>Oh, absolutely.

01:43:31.679 --> 01:43:32.079
<v SPEAKER_2>Absolutely.

01:43:32.279 --> 01:43:38.839
<v SPEAKER_2>I told her this last trip that I went out on with the 31st Mew, what I referred to him as.

01:43:39.879 --> 01:43:40.599
<v SPEAKER_2>My children.

01:43:40.959 --> 01:43:43.339
<v SPEAKER_2>I was the oldest guy, even the lieutenant.

01:43:43.579 --> 01:43:45.219
<v SPEAKER_2>He was several years younger than me.

01:43:45.239 --> 01:43:45.519
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

01:43:46.599 --> 01:43:47.159
<v SPEAKER_1>Who'd you have?

01:43:47.779 --> 01:43:48.659
<v SPEAKER_2>Lieutenant Pogmeier.

01:43:49.059 --> 01:43:50.659
<v SPEAKER_2>He's Captain Pogmeier now.

01:43:51.119 --> 01:43:51.639
<v SPEAKER_2>He's out.

01:43:51.779 --> 01:43:54.379
<v SPEAKER_2>He's in reserve, but he's activated right now.

01:43:56.499 --> 01:44:01.259
<v SPEAKER_2>Great guy, but I referred to him in a personal conversation as my children.

01:44:01.639 --> 01:44:08.039
<v SPEAKER_2>You got to take care of them, because just like if they are your children, they're a reflection of you.

01:44:08.259 --> 01:44:17.339
<v SPEAKER_2>They're a reflection of you as their leader or that, I guess, more senior figure or whatever.

01:44:17.999 --> 01:44:19.759
<v SPEAKER_2>And you're impressionable on them.

01:44:19.779 --> 01:44:21.799
<v SPEAKER_2>They're going to take just like children.

01:44:23.659 --> 01:44:27.299
<v SPEAKER_2>Not that I'm putting anybody, you know, some of those guys are smarter than I am, for sure.

01:44:27.319 --> 01:44:27.479
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

01:44:27.559 --> 01:44:30.859
<v SPEAKER_2>As far, you know, from an educational standpoint.

01:44:30.879 --> 01:44:42.279
<v SPEAKER_2>But the, yeah, it's, for me, my opinion, Marine Corps, if you're going to stick with the game, you got to be all in.

01:44:42.299 --> 01:44:44.239
<v SPEAKER_2>You can't, it's not something you can do half-heartedly.

01:44:44.639 --> 01:44:45.019
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:44:45.819 --> 01:44:49.699
<v SPEAKER_2>And if you go into it all in, I think, you know.

01:44:49.719 --> 01:44:51.699
<v SPEAKER_1>Like Sonny said the other night, all in all the time.

01:44:51.859 --> 01:44:52.359
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:44:52.379 --> 01:44:52.859
<v SPEAKER_1>No slack.

01:44:53.339 --> 01:44:53.639
<v SPEAKER_2>Yep.

01:44:53.979 --> 01:44:56.479
<v SPEAKER_2>They just painted that on their wall over there, or on their door.

01:44:56.739 --> 01:45:21.259
<v SPEAKER_2>But, yeah, if you go half, if you go in it half-hearted and you don't go all in, one, you're not going to be successful, and honestly, you're going to hurt the betterment of Marine Corps, the field we're in, the field, and the people around you, because they're depending on you to do your part, and if you're not all in, you're not doing everything you could be doing.

01:45:21.659 --> 01:45:22.439
<v SPEAKER_1>I agree with that.

01:45:25.279 --> 01:45:29.119
<v SPEAKER_1>So if you had your way, who would you like to see me interview next?

01:45:29.939 --> 01:45:31.099
<v SPEAKER_2>Let's see.

01:45:34.299 --> 01:45:34.939
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, I don't know.

01:45:35.159 --> 01:45:41.139
<v SPEAKER_2>They, I can name a few that would be interesting, if you get the opportunity.

01:45:41.239 --> 01:45:42.459
<v SPEAKER_2>Who's that?

01:45:42.459 --> 01:45:44.019
<v SPEAKER_2>Are you looking for...

01:45:45.019 --> 01:45:49.499
<v SPEAKER_1>Who would Gunny Cross or Massard Cross, I'm sorry, who would like to see me interview next?

01:45:50.279 --> 01:45:50.559
<v SPEAKER_2>The.

01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:59.800
<v SPEAKER_2>I assume you had some interesting conversations.

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:04.820
<v SPEAKER_2>Did you ever get the chance to interview old Doug Stubblefield?

01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:07.260
<v SPEAKER_2>Doug Stubblefield.

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:11.580
<v SPEAKER_2>There's another guy that taught me a lot, because that dude had the experiences.

01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:12.420
<v SPEAKER_2>Stubbs.

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.080
<v SPEAKER_2>If you ever get the chance, I would listen to that eagerly.

01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:28.880
<v SPEAKER_2>When we knew the guy, when I first met the guy, he had been in and out of the Marine Corps already a couple of times.

01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:34.960
<v SPEAKER_2>Finally found a sticking point when he came to 2600 route with us.

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:40.980
<v SPEAKER_2>And when we went on that Mew, I was slated to be the TL.

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:42.660
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, you were.

01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:43.420
<v SPEAKER_2>I was the team leader.

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:45.200
<v SPEAKER_2>And then, You got debunked.

01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:54.800
<v SPEAKER_2>You're like, They were bringing the staff sergeant in at the time of Lieutenant Beetle, Captain Beetle.

01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:01.480
<v SPEAKER_2>He said, We're gonna put him on, I don't know, you were probably involved with the conversation as well, but.

01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:06.340
<v SPEAKER_1>Actually, I think that was a transition that was made before I became part of that Mew.

01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:16.380
<v SPEAKER_1>Cause you guys had a staff and CO ops chief and a master sergeant, staff and COIC, they got pulled off for separate reasons.

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:21.800
<v SPEAKER_1>One was gonna fleet up to be the two chief and the other was gonna be just pulled out.

01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:26.800
<v SPEAKER_1>And I was gonna come in and replace both of them at the same time as a boot staff sergeant.

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:28.140
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:31.380
<v SPEAKER_2>So they said, Hey, we got this guy coming in and he's a staff sergeant.

01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:37.440
<v SPEAKER_2>Said, you know, we intend to put him out here and he's gotta be the TL.

01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:42.960
<v SPEAKER_2>And at first I was like, Oh, you gotta be damn kidding me.

01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:45.520
<v SPEAKER_2>Cause we had already went through a portion of the workup and everything, you know?

01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:50.020
<v SPEAKER_2>And, but it played out excellent.

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:58.360
<v SPEAKER_2>And I mean, to a T and looking back, I wouldn't have changed it, you know what I mean?

01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:03.260
<v SPEAKER_2>Because he had, you know, he was older guy, considerably older than me.

01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:04.900
<v SPEAKER_2>And he was older than me.

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:15.320
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, and it played, oh, and that guy, smoked Marlboro Reds like they're going out of style and drank a bottle of rum or not and still smoked me on a PFT.

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:27.940
<v SPEAKER_2>But anyways, it played out really well for us because, you know, being a little bit older and having that experience, he was able to, you know, we could only be as good as the unit we're attached to, we're tied in with.

01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:28.760
<v SPEAKER_2>And he was able to-

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.560
<v SPEAKER_2>Super good rapport with a lot of the guys in 38.

01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:33.600
<v SPEAKER_1>He was able to tune our father, Fortebus.

01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:38.280
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, he, it worked really well for us.

01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:38.820
<v SPEAKER_1>Right.

01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:39.160
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah.

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:41.460
<v SPEAKER_1>So besides Stubbs, who else?

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:51.300
<v SPEAKER_2>I think it'd be cool to, I don't know, we need to find a mash of guns in the mix somewhere.

01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:56.100
<v SPEAKER_2>Somebody that's at that, you know, that pinnacle in our field.

01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:58.360
<v SPEAKER_2>What's that?

01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:05.420
<v SPEAKER_2>Yeah, that would be an interesting route as well, to see that change over.

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:06.620
<v SPEAKER_1>I've been eyeballing Captain Boone.

01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:10.840
<v SPEAKER_2>Captain Boone, that would be, I would be eager to hear that one as well.

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:16.680
<v SPEAKER_2>Somebody that, you know, came up with us, and now, you know, moved over officer side.

01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:20.400
<v SPEAKER_2>What kind of change has that entailed?

01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:21.180
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:36.460
<v SPEAKER_2>Even Chief Warnoff, for that matter, but I think like Captain Boone, you know, somebody that sat in the back of the Humvee with us for the longest time, and now, you know, now he's company commander.

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:37.200
<v SPEAKER_2>Right.

01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:41.000
<v SPEAKER_2>To talk about how those changes, you know, the things that changed for him.

01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:43.680
<v SPEAKER_2>I think that would be super cool to hear that.

01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:54.620
<v SPEAKER_2>But, yeah, I'm trying to think of specific names, but, shit, I'll listen to them.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.420
<v SPEAKER_2>I'd be interested to listen to all of them.

01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:57.860
<v SPEAKER_2>You know, I hate to listen to them, but.

01:49:58.100 --> 01:49:58.760
<v SPEAKER_1>I appreciate it.

01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:05.660
<v SPEAKER_2>But I think those for sure would be super interesting based off the changes that, you know, that they saw.

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:08.960
<v SPEAKER_1>That they had to undergo as they transitioned in their careers.

01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:11.280
<v SPEAKER_1>Well, I appreciate it, brother.

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:13.420
<v SPEAKER_1>And with that, I'm gonna press mute.

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:18.720
<v SPEAKER_1>This has been Top Game, episode two.

01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:20.960
<v SPEAKER_1>Thanks for joining us.
